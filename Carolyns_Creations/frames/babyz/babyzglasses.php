        <b>unusual glasses for your Babyz</b><br>
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    </p>

    <p>
        These glasses were inspired by a request by Budgie, on the
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070208055821/http://s4.invisionfree.com/Insatiable/"
           target="_TOP">Insatiable forum</a>, who wanted star-shaped glasses. Later on in the
        thread, Chris suggested heart-shaped sunglasses for babyz on the beach... It caught my
        imagination and here, at last they are for download along with a very special babyz hexed by
        Tigger.

        Click on the picture to download him. He looks best if you also have installed my Elton
        Glasses and<br>
        clothes from
        <a href="http://www.geocities.com/bubble_babyz_boutique/" class="defunct"
           target="_TOP">Liz' Bubble Babyz boutique</a>. Read the readme in his zipfile :-)
    </p>

    <p>
        Also for your downloading pleasure,
        <a href="dl/babyzglasses_Blankglasses.zip"
           title="Blank Glasses">here is another pair of glasses</a> which is really three (or even
        more) in one! Please read the readme very carefully and install it properly, or it won't
        work for you. Hexers may also enjoy this one. Here are three of my own babes, hexed for me
        by some lovely people, modelling the set for you:<br>
        <img src="images/babyzglasses_WackyStarGlasses.gif" alt="wacky stars">
        <img src="images/babyzglasses_PlainHeartGlasses.gif" alt="plain hearts">
        <img src="images/babyzglasses_Plaincircleglasses.gif" alt="palin circles"><br>
        Delissa, from DStar, favours the Wacky Star glasses; Dream, from Garfield, has a classier
        taste in hearts; and Jane's Serenity seems rather fond of the simple circlets.

    <p>Enjoy!</p>
