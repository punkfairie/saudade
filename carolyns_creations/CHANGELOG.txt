Reorganized folder/file structure (only affecting where files are stored, no actual changes to UX)

Checked outside links and crossed out broken links/defunct sites, updated links if site was moved
	Changed broken links to the wayback archive if possible

Refactored code (only affecting how the source looks, actual design was kept as close as possible)
	Added external CSS files and moved all style code to there
	Updated HTML to HTML5 as much as possible while still keeping the design the same
