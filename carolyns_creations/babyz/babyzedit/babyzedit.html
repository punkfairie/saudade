    for general stuff and colour charts, Resource Hacker tips, LNZ Pro 2 tips
    etc<br>
    Go to <a href="/tutorials/LNZdetails/">my LNZ breakdown chunks</a><br>

    <p><b>NOTE</b> My tutorials mostly tell you how to edit in the days before
    <a href="/specials/nicholastools/" title="Nicholas' utilities">Nicholas'
        tools</a> were created for us all. I keep the tutorials and howtos here
    anyway because they are still useful. But wherever you see mention of
    Notepad, you can use the same info when editing the LNZ or CLZ section in
    LNZPro. And <a href="/tutorials/LNZdetails/">my LNZ info chunks </a>are
    still invaluable.</p>

    -- thanks, <a title="http://rgn.riverpebble.net" class="defunct"
        target="_TOP">L41N</a>!<br>
    This is L41N's brilliant idea. She sent me a hexer baby which I tidied up

    <p class="big"><a href="/babyz/sphinx/">Go here for Sphinx's Special

    generously offered them to the BC and, since I have fond memories of her
    jabbing, poking and encouraging me until I made many of my Babyz
    discoveries, I am very happy to have something of hers here.</span></p>

    <p><span class="big">IMPORTANT NOTE:</span><br>
    Some files that we hexers want to edit are .DLL files, such as the large
    BabyzRez.dll. Windows, by default, has files of this type "hidden" --
    presumably as some kind of safety feature, but in our case we need to see
    them. So if you cannot see them on your machine, open My Computer or Windows
    Explorer, choose View and Options, and then under View make sure that "Show
    all files" is ticked. While you're about it, un-tick "Hide MS-DOS file
    extensions", because that's a nuisance too.</p>

    <span class="normal">This is my ongoing testbed .exe file. My hope is that I
    will eventually be able to get the game to accept more playscenes, by
    avoiding the need to use the house icon. As yet in my game I have not
    been able to get it to work for the Attic and Nursery, so have not got as
    far as further scenes. I'm producing it for you in case you can do better
    with it. It does have one feature that you might enjoy; the Playpen and
    Desktop "scenes" are both usable. It overwrites your original, so please
    please make sure you put yours somewhere safe before trying mine.</span><br>

    ISO image of the complete game and an installation fix. The game is zipped
    of course, so you would need to unzip it and either burn it to a CD or mount
    it with image-mounting software. If you don't know what that means, just
    burn it to a CD.</p>

    <p>And, if you're running Windows (blech) XP or (argh blech) Vista, I

    <p class="big"><span class="normal">(Take a look also at my LNZ file

    This is part of my "Ultra-easy" editing range; this package includes all

    Wordpad and either Windows Explorer or My Computer! Woo-hoo! NOTE: You do
    have to read the included text files carefully and follow the instructions,
    or the method won't work for you. Click <a href="BabyzExtLnz2.jpg">here
    </a>to see a screengrab of my Babyz directories in Windows Explorer, so
    you can see where the .lnz files are supposed to go if you're confused.
    The icon beside the .lnz files are Notepad ones because I used Windows
    Explorer's View -> Options -> File Types menu item to Associate the .lnz
    extension with Notepad.exe.</span><br>

    This next lot is for people who want to edit items such as the bubbles from
    the bubble machine. You can only change those by editing them in the
    BabyzRez.dll file, and all the in-game bubbles will be changed if you do --
    bath bubbles etc. So if people want your bubbles they will have to download
    the external-filmstrip files.<br>

    <a href="externalfilmstripbabyzrez.zip">The Rez.dll prepared for external
        filmstrips</a><br>
    This is a 5.5 megabyte download and is just the .dll file with two bytes
    changed to make the game look for filmstrips externally. You can change the
    bytes yourself instead if you wish, but whichever you choose, you absolutely
    need to download the filmstrips.<br>

    <a href="Babyzfilmstripfiles.zip">The external filmstrips</a><br>

    This next one is a .dll which has been prepared to use external lnz as well
