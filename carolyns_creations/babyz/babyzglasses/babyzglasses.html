  <p class="bigger purple"><b>unusual glasses for your Babyz</b><br>
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

  <p>These glasses were inspired by a request by Budgie, on the <a
    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070208055821/http://s4.invisionfree.com/Insatiable/"
    target="_TOP">Insatiable forum</a>, who wanted star-shaped glasses.
    Later on in the thread, Chris suggested heart-shaped sunglasses for babyz on
    the beach... It caught my imagination and here, at last they are for
    download along with a very special babyz hexed by Tigger.</p>

  <p>In this montage by Tigger,<br>

    Click on the picture to download him. He looks best if you also have
    installed my Elton Glasses and<br>
    clothes from <a title="http://www.geocities.com/bubble_babyz_boutique/"
                    class="defunct" target="_TOP">Liz' Bubble Babyz boutique</a>.
    Read the
    readme in his zipfile :-)</p>

  <p>Also for your downloading pleasure, <a href="Blankglasses.zip"
                                            title="Blank Glasses">here is
    another pair of glasses</a> which is
    really three (or even more) in one! Please read the readme very carefully
    and install it properly, or it won't work for you. Hexers may also enjoy
    this one. Here are three of my own babes, hexed for me by some lovely
    people, modelling the set for you:<br>
    <img src="WackyStarGlasses.gif" alt="wacky stars">
    <img src="PlainHeartGlasses.gif" alt="plain hearts">
    <img src="Plaincircleglasses.gif" alt="palin circles"><br>
    Delissa, from DStar, favours the Wacky Star glasses; Dream, from Garfield,
    has a classier taste in hearts; and Jane's Serenity seems rather fond of the
    simple circlets.</p>

  <p>Enjoy!</p>
