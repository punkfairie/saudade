    <p class="bigger purple"><b>My Babyz Harem sets</b><br>
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

    <p>These "harem" items are just a bit of fun, in case anyone is upset by the
    idea. My babyz love dressing up, and they seem to enjoy my more glittery or
    diaphanous items. I usually have three babyz in the game at once, and often
    it is one boy and two girls or vice versa. I think the funniest time was
    when I had two girls in the game who were having fun with a pile of clothes
    -- and they dressed Rameses in harem pants and a belly-bow... LOL...<br>

    adorable Tevyn modelling the gold dress along with the spiky head-dress and
    a belly jewel. You can see that she enjoys belly-dancing!<br>

    diaper is not a harem item :-)<br>
