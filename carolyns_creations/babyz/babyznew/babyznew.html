      <p>
        Here are a few unusual boy babyz for you. Each is distinctive in a
        special way...
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="Xmyboy.zip" title="Xmyboy">
          <img src="Xmyboy.gif" alt="Xmyboy" /><br />
          Xmyboy </a
        ><br />
        Xmyboy has a very unusual hairstyle that shimmers as he moves
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="Shock2Lock.zip" title="Shock morphing to Lock">
          <img src="ShockMorphtoLock.gif" alt="ShockMorphtoLock" /><br />
          Shock2Lock </a
        ><br />
        Shock2Lock starts as Shock and, as the days of play pass in the game he
        morphs into Lock. Thanks to Nika for the idea of a Shock and Lock baby
        :-)
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="Tigger.zip" title="Tigger">
          <img src="Tigger.gif" alt="Tigger" /><br />
          Tigger </a
        ><br />
        Tigger has a tail which moves around as he moves. If you want to see him
        in his natural state, as shown in the picture, you will need to remove
        the White Diaper.clo file from the game's clothes directory.
