  <p class="big">This page contains any playscenes or playpen backgrounds
    etc that I make for the Babyz game.</p>

  <a href="KitchenExternal.zip" class="big">A kit for making new kitchen
    Playscenes</a><br>
  part of my "Ultra-easy" editing range. This particular one has the filmstrips
  separated out, but I have not had time to put the bitmap headers on them for
  you.<br>
  <a href="ClothesclosetExternal.zip" class="big">A kit for making new
    Clothes Closet Playscenes</a><br>
  part of my "Ultra-easy" editing range. This particular one has the filmstrips
  separated out, but I have not had time to put the bitmap headers on them for
  you.<br>
  <a href="FamilyroomExternal.zip" class="big">A kit for for making new
    Family Room Playscenes</a><br>
  part of my "Ultra-easy" editing range.<br>
  <a href="AtticExternal.zip" class="big">An easy-edit kit for making new

  <a href="BackyardExternal.zip" class="big">An easy-edit kit for making new
    Back Yard Playscenes</a><br>
  <a href="PlayroomExternal.zip" class="big">An easy-edit kit for making new
    Playroom Playscenes</a><br>
  This package lets you change your playroom to your heart's content. Make sure
  that you read the included Readme carefully, and keep a backup copy of your
  original Playroom.<br>

    My Babyz Jungle Playroom
  </a><br>
  Make sure that you read the included Readme carefully. If you already have the
  Playroom easy-edit kit, the files inside this one will overwrite the relevant
  Playroom .env, .flm, .flh and backdrop .bmp items, so make sure that you've
  got the originals stored safely before you move these into the \Resource\Area
  and \art\Sprites\Area\Playroom directories.<br>

  <span class="big">/</span>
  <a href="SecretWoodBabyz.zip" class="big" title="Download the Secret Wood">The
    secret Wood bits</a><br>
  This package lets you change your nursery to your heart's content. The picture
  shows my own latest scenario, in which I use the backdrop from my Petz Secret
  Wood scenes and I altered the window and crib-front filmstrips to simply be
  transparent. Also I've enabled the "animal" mobile. You can make more creative
  stuff than this! Make sure that you read the included Readme carefully.<br>
  If you want your playscene to look like the one in the picture, download the
  Secret Wood bits. They will overwrite the relevant Nursery window and crib
  .flm, .flh and backdrop .bmp items, so make sure that you've got the originals
  stored safely before you move these into the \art\Sprites\Area\Nursery
  directory. Click on the door if you want to see what's there. When your baby
  is tired, lift it over the patch of soft mossy grass which is on the lion's
  flank.<br>
  <span class="big">If you want to have the full "Secret wood" experience,
    download <a href="SecretWoodSounds.zip" title="Secret Wood sounds">the
      sounds </a>also.</span><br>
  The sound zip contains an overwriting Nursery file which overwrites the
  original external-nursery one. The .txt and .wav files go into the
  \art\Sprites\Area\Nursery directory.<br>

  <span class="big">These "hidden playpens" below are only needed for people who
    have a version of the game which, like mine, doesn't allow the simple
    Registry change to work.</span><br>
  I hadn't realised that there was more than one version of the game until 2004
  -- only one game release, but two or three versions. For people who would like
  to try it, <a href="/babyz/babyzsecretplaypen/">click here</a> for a little
  trick which might work for you; Daniel Wright pointed out that this works for
  his game, and probably for many other people's. If it doesn't work for yours,
  you can either go to Daniel's <a href="http://www.dmwright.com/babyz/"
    class="defunct">The Babyz Crib</a> where I'm told he has an .exe file which
  works with this fix, or try the two patchfiles below instead. These patchfiles
  of mine will give you a new default "logo" picture for the playpen, as well as
  a new splash-screen and "Grandmother's House" screen.<br>

      title="Download the Playpen with Shag Carpet">Playpen with Shag
    Carpet</a><br>
  NOTE: The above playpens are in the form of patchfiles. They patch your game's
  main executable file. Make a copy of any file that you intend to patch, as
  these are important files and you will one day want your original back
  again!<br>
  If you have a babyz.exe which is a different size from mine, these patches
  won't work for you; also my instructions will be slightly off because the
  place you'll be looking for will be in a different place. In that case, if you
  want to edit the internal pictures, all I can suggest is that you try using
  <a href="http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/" target="_top">ResHacker</a> to
  replace the bitmaps that you want to change. But I cannot stress enough; if
  you're going to edit your .exe, keep a backup copy safe somewhere else just in
  case you get a corruption, and also make sure that you have safe copies of all
  your adopted babyz.<br>
