  Page 1 of my hexed Babyz toyz -- the latest ones are on this page. They all
  show up seperately in the closet with their own graphics. You need to extract
  the .toy file into your Resource\Toyz directory in your Babyz program
  directory.

      The kitchen magnets, separated out and made to show up in the kitchen
      closet. This one is for people who find that their magnets disappear, also
      for hexers who want to make a range of magnets of their own. They don't
      overwrite the original, and as far as I know you cannot put them back in
      the closet, so take care how you litter the kitchen with them, LOL!<br>

      The Christmas Spoon, made originally for DRN's 2005 Advent Calendar. You
      will find that food looks different when it's on this spoon :-)<br>

      The "Surprise" toy, made to show up in your attic closet. This seems to be
      a toy that the makers forgot about; in the Petz 4 game, the surprise is
      that there's a bubble machine inside. In Babyz, the makers forgot to
      delete the bubble machine filmstrips when they made that toy separate, and
      they didn't finish the box off. I've finished it off for you, and now the
      "surprise" is that you can use it to stuff more toyz into your toychestz,
      LOL! It overwrites the original. Version 1 is the standard box with lid,
      version 2 has a surprise lid :-) Hexers may be interested in version 2,
      which gives something extra to fiddle with.<br>

      At last! The Teletubbies comes to amuse your Babyz! LOL... This will
      overwrite your Record Player and Record toyz, so make sure that you have
      them somewhere safe. You may get tired of seeing your babyz eternally
      watching TV, even when you're playing classy music :-)<br>
      Your babyz will dance to the teletubbies music when you put the tape into
      the slot.<br>
      Thanks to Kittycat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090430194112/http://www.geocities.com/xxwaterfallheavenxx/index.html" target="_TOP">of Waterfall Heaven</a> for the idea, the music and a
      bunch of basic graphics which I altered, added to and made into the toyz;
      this is really a kind of "team creation". Note that although the
      teletubbies disco music is supposed to come on when you insert the little
      tape from the shelf, you may sometimes find that the music is actually
      linked to a different record. That's just a random quirk of the game.<br>

      If you have problems with the toy not showing up correctly, download this
      version instead:<br>

      This one is a complete toy with everything inside -- go to my tutorials
      page if you want my external-files one. This was made as I went through
      the steps myself when answering a couple of people who wanted to know how
      to make their treats show up properly. The Howto and example toy are on my
      tutorials page.<br>

      Another special request, this time from Liz as well as Dani. This toy
      overwrites the original Stuffed Man, and shows up in the playroom closet.
      It's the toy to use if you want to make a doll or similar type of toy, but
      don't want to have to fiddle with .lnz files. People who want to change
      the look of their stuffed man can of course use Tinker, available on this
      site's "Nicholas' tools" page :-)<br>

      These two plants can now be put back on the playroom and attic shelves,
      plus they can now be moved between scenes in the toychest. The Babyz will
      be a bit more interested in them than they used to be.<br>
