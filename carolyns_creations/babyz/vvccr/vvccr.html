      <b>Viavoice for Babyz</b><br />
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    </p>

    <p>
      Make a directory off your main drive and call it vvccr<br />
      Then download all these and place them in the vvccr directory.
      double-click on Setup.exe to install your viaVoice.
    </p>

    <p>
      PLEASE NOTE you're on your own with this one. I never bothered to install
      ViaVoice off my Babyz CD, and I do not use either Windows XP or Vista to
      play with Babyz so I cannot help if you have ViaVoice problems with those
      OSes. The files you see below are exactly as they were on my CD, including
      the Read files, so if there are links in the readme files that don't work,
      that's IBM's fault.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are all the files, zipped up together for people who are having
      trouble downloading the individual files.<br />
      <a href="vvccr.zip">Complete vvcr contents</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      And for people who have lost their CD and cannot find another anywhere,
      <a href="/babyz/babyzfix/">here is a page</a> where you can find a backup
      ISO image of the complete game and an installation fix. The game is zipped
      of course, so you would need to unzip it and either burn it to a CD or
      mount it with image-mounting software. If you don't know what that means,
      just burn it to a CD.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to get just an individual file from the Viavoice setup set,
      here they are unpacked for you.
