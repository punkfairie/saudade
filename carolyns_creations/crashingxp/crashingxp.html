  <b>In Windows XP; unexplained AC crashes, and sound problems</b><br>

  Sound Problems with WinXP SP2<br>
  =============================
</p>

<p>
  Windows XP with SP2 has special new quirks, and Petz 5 apparently starts up
  with a sounds error message now. Kahlah has posted an alert about this on <a
  href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060105132413/http://lesley.proboards21.com/index.cgi?boardpetforum"
  target="_top">the APKC/BCKC forum </a>, you may find more info there, but
  here's the quick fix for you: If Petz 5 won't play sounds for you, find the
  two files smapi.dll and setupapi.dll which are both where you installed Petz 5
  (probably C:\Program Files\UBI Soft\Studio Mythos\Petz 5) and delete them. If
  you cannot see .dll files on your machine, open My Computer, Choose View
  Options from the menu, and make sure that View all files is ticked on the View
  tab. Then you'll see those files and can remove them. Actually, Petz 5 will
  run just fine without most of the files which are in that main directory.

<p>
  Breedfiles Crashing problems<br>
  ===========================
</p>

<p>
  Okay, I'm writing this because it seems that people -- usually with Windows
  XP, but also sometimes with updated Windows ME systems -- are getting Petz 4
  or 5 doing a crash-to-desktop when trying to bring some of my breedz out at
  the Adoption centre. Sometimes it happens with already-adopted petz when they
  try to breed. In most cases, there is nothing wrong with the breedfile. I
  always check when someone reports a problem and, if the breed does not crash
  my game, you have come up against the "XP-nasties". This is a problem that I
  am unable to duplicate because I do not have (and never intend to have) that
  operating system on my machine (or Windows ME either), and all my breedz work
  fine on my system.
</p>

<p>
  From what I can gather, it tends to be mostly Mutt or Dalmatian-based breedz
  which crash in this manner, and I have found that people who complain about
  this can often run the breedz fine if I remove a certain part from the file. I
  have no time now to go through every single one of my breedz to re-do them
  just in case they produce this problem which doesn't happen for me, nor do I
  want to mess them about like that, so I'm telling you here what you can try in
  order to get the pets to come out or breed for you.
</p>

<p>
  First of all, make sure you've downloaded the sound-stripped version of the
  breedfile as opposed to the patchfile version. I believe that people have been
  having other problems with Windows ME or XP and the patchfiles. I do not now
  have patchfiles at this site, but if you got one from somewhere else, dump it
  and grab the proper one.
</p>

<p>
  Now, either using <a href="http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/"
  target="_top">ResHacker </a>or a hex editor of your choice, remove the [Fur
  Markings] which are below [Ballz Info]. If this doesn't fix the problem, also
  remove the [Fur Color Areas].
</p>

<p>
  With ResHacker you can either delete the whole [Fur Markings] section from the
  beginning of [Fur Markings] down to directly before [Lnz Version] (do not
  touch [Lnz Version]) or simply insert a semi-colon at the beginning of each
  line (this is a "comment-out") but not the [Lnz Version] line. If you're
  removing [Fur Color Areas] also, similarly delete or comment-out from the
  beginning of [Fur Color Areas] to directly before [Lnz Version]. Compile,
  save, and run the game with the breedfile in place.
</p>

<p>
  With a hex editor you can replace all the part from the beginning of [Fur
  Markings] (or [Fur Color Areas]) down to and including the last number
  <b>before</b> [Lnz Version] with spaces. Save, and run the game with the
  breedfile in place.
</p>

<p>
  The pet should come out of the Adoption Centre now even with horrible old
  Windows XP, and if it doesn't then I can't help you -- as I said before, my
  breedz work fine in my game just as they are.
