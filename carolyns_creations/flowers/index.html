    <b>Beautiful gifts...</b><br>
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

  <p class="big">Well, it's near the end of 2005 already and I didn't manage
    to get the birthday page up yet. Never mind, I've been enjoying the gifts
    myself anyway and one day perhaps I'll get them up for y'all to see on my
    2004-2005 pages :-) But meanwhile, here's Phantarella playing with her best
    friend, Insanity (thanks, Meer!). The two of them are vey unsure of my very
    latest pet, but I've told them they needn't worry -- Beeble won't eat them.
    Beeble, the carnivorous plant, was crafted by Signofish and sent to me by
    Minibyte.<br>

    Also in 2005 this special trio was hexed for me. I made this banner to use
    as a sig at the Shiznit forum, and now that is gone I display it here with
    pride<br>

  <p class="big">and here are three lovelies -- one special babyz sent out of
    the blue and two (yes, two!) petz from Wardah Ahmar. The School of Fish petz
    is great fun to play with, you can see that Farana is fascinated. GoldaFishe
    has a constant companion fish, and her tail makes clever use of
    polygons.<br>

    Several babyz hexers have been very kind in surprising me with special
    babyz, and each one sparks a lovely memory. Three were sent as birthday
    gifts, one commemorates poor little Pop, another is made to remind me of my
    childhood bear... Well, they all have a special meaning to me.<br>

    Apart from the above, which were made for me as special gifts, I have been
    very lucky in being allowed to adopt many petz and babyz over the years. All
    are doing well, still in my game and much enjoyed. I've not lost or deleted
    a single one, and I never intend to :-)</p>

  <p class="big">In basic date order, below you can click to see beautiful
    picture-gifts:<br>
    <a href="/carolyns_creations/flowerza/">given to me in the years 2004-2005</a><br>
    People were very kind to me over the earlier years of this site's existence,
    and the lovely flowers and picture gifts built up to the point where I got
    into a mess over how to display them. In the end, I decided to keep the
    pages that I made previously; you can get to them at the link below:<br>
    <a href="/carolyns_creations/flowers1/">Flowers given to me before 2004</a><br>
    I love them all, each one is special to me because it means that I've made
    people happy with what I enjoy doing. Thank you all!</p>
