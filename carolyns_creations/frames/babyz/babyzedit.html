    <p>
        <span class="big">IMPORTANT NOTE:</span><br>
        Some files that we hexers want to edit are .DLL files, such as the large BabyzRez.dll. Windows, by default, has
        files of this type "hidden" -- presumably as some kind of safety feature, but in our case we need to see them.
        So if you cannot see them on your machine, open My Computer or Windows Explorer, choose View and Options, and
        then under View make sure that "Show all files" is ticked. While you're about it, un-tick "Hide MS-DOS file
        extensions", because that's a nuisance too.

        This next lot is for people who want to edit items such as the bubbles from the bubble machine. You can only

        This is a 5.5 megabyte download and is just the .dll file with two bytes changed to make the game look for

        for you to use with LNZPro -- thanks, <a href="http://rgn.riverpebble.net" class="defunct"
        target="_TOP">L41N</a>, for the great idea and the base baby!<br>
        <span class="normal">If you download this baby and study how to edit it in LNZPro, once you're used to that
			you should be able to rehex any of your own babyz in the same way. This is not intended as a method for
			thieves to steal code, and you can be assured that the BC will notice if you do that :-)</span>

        Apart from the "basic" tutorial, the following "howto"s tend to assume that you already know how to edit .baby
        files. Some of them are also relevant to editing pet files, but don't let that confuse you. The methods are the
        same. Unless you are using LNZPro (recommended to you since the wonderful version 3!), you need to edit in a hex
        editor and compensate for the checksum.
