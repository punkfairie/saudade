        These "harem" items are just a bit of fun, in case anyone is upset by the idea. My babyz
        love dressing up, and they seem to enjoy my more glittery or diaphanous items. I usually
        have three babyz in the game at once, and often it is one boy and two girls or vice versa. I
        think the funniest time was when I had two girls in the game who were having fun with a pile
        of clothes -- and they dressed Rameses in harem pants and a belly-bow... LOL...<br>

        adorable Tevyn modelling the gold dress along with the spiky head-dress and a belly jewel.
        You can see that she enjoys belly-dancing!<br>

        modelling the spiky collar and head-dress along with a belly bow. The white diaper is not a
        harem item :-)<br>
