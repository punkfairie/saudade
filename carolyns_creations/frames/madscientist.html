    <!-- Cat Chew Fam ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <p>
        Today The Mad Scientist presents the ultimate in inbreeding for your disgust or entertainment. The zipfile
        contains the hidden "test" .LNZ from Petz 5's resource .dlls, and the pet which it creates. But being crazy of
        course I go further than that; I then copied the pet, turned the copy into a boy, and thus bred the pet with
        itself.<br>

        <img src="img/madscientist_CatChewFam.gif" alt="_Cat_Chew family"><br>

        As you can see, the little lady isn't quite sure where those horns came from on her dainty little babe...<br>

        <a href="dl/madscientist_TheCatChewFamily.zip">The _Cat_Chew_ family for Catz 3, 4 or 5</a>.
    </p>

    <!-- Cerberus ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <p>
        More crazy graftings! The Mad Scientist presents Cerberus, the snake-tailed 3-headed dog, for your delectation.
        Actually, a pair of Cerberus family petz...<br>

        <img src="img/madscientist_Cerberus2.gif" alt="Cerberus pet">

        <a href="dl/madscientist_CerberusPetz.zip">For Dogz 3, 4 or 5</a>. The cute li'l baby is not included, awwww...
        but, for those who want to breed with these petz (you<b>must</b> be bonkers!!) here is
        <a href="dl/madscientist_CerberusLNZ.zip">the .LNZ file</a>, for use with my external-lnz Great Dane packages
        which you can get from the "For LNZ-files 'n' easy-edits" pages; it will of course overwrite the normal Dane's
        .LNZ. Read the readme in the easy-edit package if you don't know what to do with .LNZ files.
    </p>

    <!-- Cat 'o' Nine Tails ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <p>
        The Mad Scientist has taken to grafting things onto petz -- bwahahaha! She presents the Cat 'o' Nine Tails (and
        three heads, she got really carried away). Cerberus, the snake-tailed 3-headed dog will be with us at a later
        date.<br>

        <a href="dl/madscientist_Scamparella.zip">For Catz 3, 4 or 5</a>. For those who want to breed with it (are you
        <b>crazy</b>)?? here is <a href="dl/madscientist_CatONineTailsLNZ.zip">the .LNZ file</a>, for use with my
        external-lnz Alley-cat packages which you can get from the "For LNZ-files 'n' easy-edits" pages; it will of
        course overwrite the normal Alley's .LNZ. Read the readme in the easy-edit package if you don't know what to do
        with .LNZ files.

    <!-- Petz 5 Nursery Freedom EXE ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <p>
        The mad scientist strikes again... Freeing your nursing mothers from the drudgery of the Nursery, allowing the
        fathers to play or two mothers to chat while their broods play together. You can either

        <a href="tutorials/Petz5NurseryFix.html">do it yourself</a> or you can download an
        <a href="dl/madscientist_Petz5exeNurseryFreedom.zip" title="Download fixed exe">especially-modified exe file</a>

        As a bonus, this modified exe contains three fixes; one allows your nursing mothers to come out of the Nursery
        if they wish, the second provides the "import from Petz 4" menu item, and the third provides the Petz profile as
        a menu item. I found it irritating having to partway open the carry-case in order to select a pet, also I
        sometimes want to see pet data without taking out any pets. This menu item allows this. I also changed the
        splash screen so that you know which exe you're using. Make sure that you keep your original somewhere safe --
        this one overwrites your original, and I take no responsibility if it crashes your game. It works fine in my
        game, so if it doesn't in yours and you get abducted by aliens in white coats instead -- well, that's life.<br>

        <img src="img/madscientist_petz4import.jpg" alt="petz 4 import in menu"> .
        <img src="img/madscientist_petzprofile.jpg" alt="Petz profile in menu"><br>
        <img src="img/madscientist_NurseryfreeFamily.jpg" alt="nursery-free family"><br>

        Note: if you get the multiple-cloned-babes effect, go to the Nursery, put mum away and then go back to another
        scene. The "clones" will disappear. Or you can close the game and re-open it; they will have gone then too. If
        you don't know what I'm talking about, then you're not being bothered by it and you need do nothing :-)
    </p>

    <!-- Babyz Menu EXE ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <p>
        <a href="dl/madscientist_BabyzEXEWithMenu.zip">Modified Babyz Exe for Playpen access</a><br>

        The mad scientist produces her ongoing testbed .exe file for Babyz. The idea was to eventually be able to get
        the game to accept more playscenes, by avoiding the need to use the house icon which goes berserk if a
        non-overwriting scene is added. As yet in my game I have not been able to get it to work for the Attic and
        Nursery, so have not got as far as further scenes. It does have one feature that Babyz players might enjoy; the
        Playpen and Desktop "scenes" are both usable. NOTE: It overwrites your original so please, folks, put yours
        somewhere safe. The mad scientist takes no responsibility for anything from game-crashes through to
        flame-throwers decimating your backyard and more;<b>remember, she's crazy :-)</b><br>

    <!-- LNZ Details -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

        <a href="tutorials/lnzdetails.php">Click here for LNZ debowellings</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Read a whole bunch of the mad scientist's delvings into the .LNZ file. All the gory details are laid bare in a
        minute dissection of the Key Texts (or commands), key-words and programmers' comments. This is not a tutorial or
        a how-to, it is an explanation of all those mysterious gobbets of data inside the .lnz files. Mainly it's a Petz
        breakdown, but Oddballz and babyz fans take note, most of what I describe in this is relevant to you also. Plus,
        I shall be making similar breakdowns of the areas which are different, or specific only to, those games as soon
        as I can.

    <!-- Insane Calicoz ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <p>
        I have been experimenting for many years to find the limits of what these games can take, and delving deep into
        the files, dabbling my fingers in the genetic pool, gender-bending petz and generally creating strangenesses of
        great peculiarity. And at last the mad-scientist brain has snapped and I present to you...<br>

        (sound effects of crazy cackling, sudden thunderstorm lashes at window, wind comes howling though, lightning
        flashes...)<br>

        To see the above breed in action, you will need the dogz part of the game <b>and</b> either the catz part of
        the game or the "catz behaviours" package which I've got on my "Cat species in dogz" page. It will not work if
        you only have catz or only have dogz. Hah! A true cross-breed! But please read the included Readme textfile. You
        cannot adopt from this breed... So, included in the package are a pair of petz who are happy in their total
        insanity. And for the soft-hearted, if you cannot bear the sight of Jilli and Jeffri tearing themselves apart,
        also included in the package is a zip of the two of them restored to sanity.

    <!-- Wireframe Petz + Babyz --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <p>
        And now for something completely different. The petz can breed and I include a baby, freshly separated from her
        mother, in the zipfile; on the other hand, the wire Babyz doesn't breed but it does grow :-)<br>
