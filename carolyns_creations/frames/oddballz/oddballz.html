        NOTE -- Since the arrival of <a href="../specials/nicholastools.php">Tinker 1.5</a>, editing the "Easy kit"
        filmstrips and customising the whole look of your game is now beautifully simple! You can change the whole look
        of your game and toyz, and you can share the results with other Easy kit users :-)

        And here are some different mice that I made using the Catz 1 and Petz 3 mice .LNZ files as reference. They
        also need my <a href="dl/oddballz_OddzRezEasy-edit.zip">Oddballz Easy kit </a>to be installed first.<br>

        used along with my easy-edit kits to customise your own game.

        The "lnz info" pages are a breakdown of all the items which can be put into your breedz' lnz, along with
        information and syntax. The Oddballz-specific ones are still not yet written up, but if you browse through all
        the ones for Petz you should get a clear idea of what each part does.
