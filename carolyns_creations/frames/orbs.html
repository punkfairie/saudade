        Thanks to Ashien, my petz now have orbs to reflect their natures and poses. An enchanting idea, along the lines
        of having guardian angels for your site -- but instead, it's orbs which match the mood of your pet's picture.

        Aren't they great? If you want some too, I quote her words from The Petz Board: 'To have your pictures
        "orbified" all you have to do is e-mail me your pictures (as bitmaps, please!) to
        Kait.Az@unseeuniversity.zzn.com and I will assign them an appropriate orb as soon as humanly possible.'

        If you want orbs on your actual petz, take a look at my <a href="specials/emoticonpetz1.php">Emoticon
        petz\breed</a> pages
    </p>

    <p class="bigger">
        You can also find petz with permanent orbs which show in the game, at Sue's <a
