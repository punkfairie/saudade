		These are the very few clothes that I've made for the Petz 3 game. I don't have a great
		interest in making petz clothes, mainly because there have always been a lot of people out
		there making great stuff pretty much since the game first came out. But there were a couple
		of things that people wanted to know how to do, and here they are.
