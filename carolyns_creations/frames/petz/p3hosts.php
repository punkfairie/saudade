		<b>Petz 3 versions of the P4 Hosts Adoptable With Clothing For All P3 Petz</b><br>
		Click photo or name to download.
	</p>

	<p>
		My thanks to Carol, aka Minibyte, for converting my Petz 4 versions to Petz 3 -- and for
		re-kindling my interest so that I made them look right in the closet at last!
	</p>

	<p>
		Please note -- these are the Hosts, exactly as they were made by the game's creators. They
		were of course never intended to have a "normal" petz life in the game, without their
		special clothes. I wanted you to have the <b>real</b> Hosts, so I made no changes. If you
		don't like Bear's back legs, or Wyatt's ears and wrists, or the way Peg and Pharaoh look,
		then I suggest that you either adopt a different pet instead or always keep their proper
		clothes on.<br>
		Also I am providing an alternative Peg, because I gather that in some people's games Peg
		does not have the grey wrist-cuffs that she does in mine. So you get to choose :-)
