        <b>This page contains any playscenes that I may hex for the Petz 5 game; I don't make scenes with the game's
            editor, because there are people who make much better ones that way than I can, but on occasion I may want
            to alter one of the game's original scenes. When I do, I'll post it here.</b>

        The Petz 5 version of the Secret Wood is now available complete for you to download. It will look best if you
        download the carrycase Skin from my <a href="p5skinz.html">skins page</a>, and the toyz -- and I strongly
        recommend that you download the sounds also. Click on various things, such as the knot-hole by the lion's nose,
        for some little surprises, and have fun with the birdie-house and Scarab (dung-beetle). You can pick them up and
        move them around the place. The beetle does a dung-beetle's job of clearing up dirt, and the birdie-house keeps
        time for you. Oh, and there is a shelf in the bower above the Lion.<br>I hope you enjoy this scene and find it
        as magical as I do.<br>

        This is actually an easy-edit kit, so take care to follow the included instructions. I have made the backdrops
        256-colour to make a smaller download, and I have altered the daytime backdrop to the Petz 3 or Petz 4 one for
        nostalgia freaks like myself. If you want the Adoption Centre birdsong, <a

            Petz 5 AdoptionGone Editor-created playscene
        </a><br>
        This is my one and only Editor-created playscene, which is really my test scene created to see what could and
        couldn't be done with the Editor. I thought it turned out kind of fun, so here it is :-)
