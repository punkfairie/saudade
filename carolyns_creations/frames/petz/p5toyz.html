			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br></span>
        These are the few toyz that I've either made or altered to have show up in the carrycase for the Petz 5
        game.<br>
        For people who are worried about the necessary Registry entry for some of the following toyz, please click <a
        href="../tutorials/RegistryHowto.html">here</a>, <b>NOTE</b> that this is just a howto to explain the use of
        Regedit if you've downloaded one of my non-overwriting toyz! But now that we have our National Treasure --
        Nicholas -- why not instead download Tinker? Go to my Nicholas' Tools page for <a
        href="../specials/nicholastools.php">a link to his site</a> and some tips on using his utilities... Once you've
        downloaded it, use Tinker's File, Modify Carrying case, feature.

            These will overwrite the towel and sponge from the Salon scene, so put your originals somewhere safe. Once
            taken out of the case, they cannot be put back. If you want to remove them from a scene, close the game,
            move the two toys to a temporary directory, then open the game. You can then close the game and put them
            back in the toyz directory.

            This Mint drink is a brand-new toy for Petz 5.<br>
            It was hexed from the Milk Bottle and is intended as an example for a tutorial. It shows up slightly
            differently on the shelf simply because I changed the colour of some pixels in the filmstrip, in a similar
            way to that mentioned in my "simple filmstrip editing" for PII, 3 and 4. But if you want to try the same
            thing, be warned -- the method results are not predictable in Petz 5. Editing spr files by hand is tortuous;
            you're best using a special SPR-editing tool for the job.
