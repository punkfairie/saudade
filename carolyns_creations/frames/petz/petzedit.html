        them on your machine, open My Computer or Windows Explorer, choose View and Options, and then under View make
        sure that "Show all files" is ticked. While you're about it, un-tick "Hide MS-DOS file extensions", because
        that's a nuisance too.

        <b id="NEW">Where to find latest "Howto"s etc</b><br>
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    </p>

    <p class="big">
        Usually the newest items are at the top of the relevant section -- Petfiles (for editing the actual pet files),
        Breedz main (for major breedz tutorials), Breedz info (for important information -- variations, 2nd-gens, etc),
        Breedz bits (for all the odds and ends, such as ears and tails etc), Copy/Pasties, Scene/toy/clo (for scenes,
        toyz, clothing, and Doors-and-mice easy-edit packages and "howto"s). Some things are a little different,
        though...
    </p>

    <p>
		<span class="big">Go to <a href="../tutorials/LNZdetails.html">my LNZ breakdown chunks</a><br> for my latest
			delvings into the guts of hexing.</span><br>
        will always contain my latest information on the .lnz files as and when I have the time to write my notes as
        clearly as possible for you<br>

        <span class="big">Go to <a href="../tutorials/tutorials.html">my main tutorial page</a><br> for the stuff that
			doesn't fit anywhere or is relevant to other games also,</span><br>
        such as how to fix some problems in ResHacked files. This will always contain my latest tips and bits of
        information about everything else I can think of, which doesn't fit neatly in specific Babyz, Petz or Oddballz
        tutorials pages, as and when I think of it or have the time to write it down for you.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="big">NOTE 1:</span> You can use the information that's in my hexing tutorials for Petz 4 to help
        you to hex-edit in Petz 5. The files are basically the same, with only a few minor differences which I cover in
        my converting "howto". I promise you, you don't need fresh tutorials for Petz 5, although I have done my best to
        update all my older ones anyway. All the newer Petz "howtos" are for Petz 5 as well as the earlier games --
        except for filmstrip editing. In Petz 5 the filmstrips need to be split into individual frames, which means that
        filmstrip-based toyz editing and making clothes show up on the shelf as objects not already somewhere in the
        game is not a sane thing to do by hand in Petz 5. You need a special tool such as <a
        href="../nicolastools.html">Tinker</a> for that.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="big">NOTE 2:</span> Hex-painting and the creating of hexed litterz is usually -- and up until I
        released info on petfile editing was always -- done by hex-editing a breedfile without renaming it, and adopting
        pets from the edited breed. If you want to "hex-paint" by editing an individual pet, then that seems like a lot
        of effort for very little return -- but if you want to do it, take a look at one of my advanced "howtos" on pet
        editing, in the "petfiles" section of this page. Or, as of the year 2005, grab LNZPro from my "Nicholas' Tools"
        page -- you can edit pet files with that now.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="big">NOTE 3:</span> Several of my breed-hexing "howto"s contain example breedz. These breedz just
        happen to be the ones that I was checking my facts with as I wrote the relevant tutorial, so I popped them into
        the zip. I usually work with Petz 3 (it's fast to load) or Petz 4 (it has good error messages and is fairly
        quick to load), so the breedfiles are likely to be for one of those games. You are hexers, or else you wouldn't
        be interested in my "howto"s and tutorials, would you? So my theory was that if you want to see my results in
        action, you can easily either copy the .lnz into the appropriate breed in your chosen version of the game, or
        you can convert the breed to that version for your own use. It appears that this has simply muddled people;
        sorry about that. I've been intending to convert all of them, therefore, and post them on the <a
        href="tutbreedz.html"> "tutorial examples" </a>page. This is very low on my list of priorities just now, though!

        <span class="big">NOTE 1:</span> You will notice in various places I say that Petz 5 SPR filmstrip files are not
        editable. Individually, by hand, this is true; the filmstrips have to be chopped into individual frames for
        editing, and they are even more difficult and time-consuming to split apart by hand than the filmstrip-sections
        of earlier games. I have not yet written up a "howto" for it -- and now I never shall, because there is no
        point, LOL! Tinker is now available for the task, available from my "Nicholas' tools" page, and wannabe
        filmstrip editors can make a whole range of great toyz etc without the drudgery :-) Really all my
        filmstrip-editing tutorials have now become redundant, useful only to hexing purists and historians... They will
        have served their purpose in filling the gap while no tool was available, and in giving the programmers Jonathan
        Grinshpan (of Oddballz Eggz Scrambler fame) and Nicholas (of Tinker fame) handy information for tool-making.

        data into a petfile, and we would need to alter checksums in order to even try removing that.
        <span class="normal">Soon we may have a tool to do precisely that, and then maybe there will be more
			"corruptions" that we can fix. But by hand, for now, the only thing that can we can do is to "clone" your

			re-adopt it as a puppy or kitten from the Petz 3 or Petz 4 Adoption centre. It will lose its memory and
			history, but the body will be your pet's. You can even pop your original pet's personality/genetics into
			the new petfile, although out of consideration for the new pet I'd be inclined to do this in a <b>copy
			</b> of the new pet. And no, I haven't got a "howto" up on how to do this; it's complicated "surgery" and

        <span class="normal">This has been updated somewhat; it includes converting Petz 3 breedz from English to
			International, also converting to petz 5. It attempts to cover converting back and forward between all
			versions of the Petz games. Note that, since this tutorial was written, Resource Hacker became usable and
			it swept the newer hexing community by storm. The trouble with this is that, if you are trying to convert
			a ResHacked breed, it's no longer so simple to do it in a hex editor, because Resource Hacker moves
			things around inside the file when it compiles and saves. If the ones you want to convert have been
			"ResHacked", then your best bet is either to copy out the .lnz sections and any bitmaps, and make an
			overwriting breed using my External-LNZ breedz, or to get ResHacker yourself and become familiar with its
			use. I do not do Resource Hacker tutorials, although I do have hints on odd things such as how to insert
