		<b>Catz 3, 4 and 5 Mouse "grubz" for you</b><br>
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	</p>

	<p>
		NOTE: To use these, you will need to either download and install my mice etc Easy-edit
		packages, available from my Petz Easy-edit page, or you'll need to edit your game's Resource
		file in order to insert these grubz. I advise the first of those two options, as you can
		keep shuffling your mice and grubz around to your heart's content :-)
	</p>

	<p>
		These "grubz" will overwrite your game's own mouse files. Please put your originals
		somewhere safe, and read the readme files included!
