			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br></span>

        On this page you'll find pictures and info about the great utilites made by Nicholas Sherlock.<br>
        <a href="https://www.sherlocksoftware.org/" target="_blank" title="Nicholas' own site!">Go to his site</a><br>
        to download his great utilities :-) Also there you'll find a useful forum; go there to suggest ideas or ask for
        help.
    </p>

    <p>
        These work on my Windows 95 system, and should work for everyone. Nicholas has provided helpfiles for some of
        the utilities, but anyway they are super-easy to use. There is of course now the LNZ info helpfile compiled by
        Nicholas from my LNZ Info early last year, and Kishi Kat of the beautiful <a
        href="http://www.kishikat.com/tlf/" class="defunct" target="_blank">The Light Fantastic</a> site has made a neat
        tutorial for Tinker. Go to her site for some great toyz and other goodies!<br>
        I have also now made some tips on using <a href="../tutorials/TinkerAndLNZPro2tips.html">Tinker</a> and more for
        <a href="../tutorials/LNZPro2tips.html">LNZPro version 2 (or later)</a>, you can also get to those from my main
        tutorials page. Nicholas has now made a great helpfile on using Pet Workshop for variations, you can get it from
        his site, and go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060225132724/http://gkcpetz.fapetz.com/app.html"
        target="_blank">Genuine Kennels' All Purpose Petz </a>for a superb illustrated tutorial on using Pet
        Workshop!
    </p>

    <p>
        The programs did not cause any problems with corruptions or crashes in my game, but they are basically still in
        development and of course you should <b>always</b> make backup copies of any file that you are going to edit.
