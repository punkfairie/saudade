  <p class="big purple"><b>Links archive</b><br>
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

  <p class="big">All my links except for the ones on this page are unlikely to
    work. I have kept the pages of links as an archive which you my by all means
    browse; you might strike lucky and find one which works. I do not have time
    to check them all, sorry.<br>

  <p><span class="purple big"><b>How to contact me</b><br>
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span><br>
    <span class="big">hex-help at hornsc dot clara dot co.uk<br>
    (change "at" for an @ sign and "dot" for a period.</span><br>
    I've done it like this to try and keep spam at bay)<br>
    If you try to write to me and the mail bounces, well -- it shouldn't, so try
    again. I don't have any filters in place to prevent your mail from getting
    to me, so if there is a problem of any kind it will be something temporary
    at either my or your ISP.<br>
    Please note that I always reply to email as soon as I can, and deal with
    items that have been sent to me or at least acknowledge receipt of them. If
    you haven't heard back from me within 48 hours, please drop me a note to
    check that I did get the message or file; I don't mind little reminders, and
    it is just possible that email is getting lost sometimes.<br>
    Also I always try to make my reply as useful as possible. So I find it
    really annoying when I've spent time on a careful reply to someone, only to
    have it bounced back with "not accepting mail from this sender". If you are
    going to ask me a question, please try to make sure that you can receive my
    answers!!</p>
