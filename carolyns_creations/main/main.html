    **On behalf of my dear friend, Carolyn and myself,<br>
    I'd like to give a HUGE THANKS to Arie for now hosting Carolyn's
    Creations!<br>

    <p class="big">My lovely Guardian Angel Cat logo was a gift from <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090223114521/http://www.geocities.com/fbkc5/"
        target="_top">Thowraa's FBKC</a><br>
    To play with her online, <a href="/phantarella/">click here</a>. You'll need
    the <a href="PetzPlayer.exe">Petz player plug-in (click)</a>, and
    the latest browsers won't support that So unless you already have Netscape,
    you also need to download <a href="Netscape4InstallFiles.zip">Netscape
        Commander 4 (click)</a>. Unzip and install Netscape, it won't affect any
    of your other browsers. Choose to install the included cosmo Player if it
    asks, because then you'll be able to play with the Catz 1 <a
        href="/petz/dream/">Catz World </a>! Then double-click on the Player to
    install it and you'll be able to play with Phantarella.</p>

    <p>This is an archive of all the items that I have ever hex-edited or
    converted for the various P.F.Magic Petz, Oddballz and Babyz games. It also
    includes my stuff for Petz 5 which was created in 2002 by Studio Mythos and
    is in the same style as the older games. The websites for these games are
    now gone -- the new Dogz, Catz etc games which you see at <a
        href="http://www.petz.com/" target="_top">Ubisoft's Petz </a>site, and
    the various girly games for Nintendo DS at <a href="http://www.babyz.net/"
        target="_top">their "Babyz.net" </a>site are in no way similar to the
    original Petz etc games and are not covered in my tutorials. I also do not
    have downloads for any Ubisoft games created from 2006 onwards. All that I
    have for you of those later games is my <a href="/petz6/" target="main"
        title="Catz and Dogz 2006">Info Only</a> page, which may be useful
    for anyone wanting to "hex" or modify the PC versions of those games.</p>

    <p><b class="big">People with Dogz-only or Catz-only parts of the Petz games
    please read</b><br>
    If you want one of my breedz, please don't ask me to convert between dogz
    and catz games -- instead, download the relevant package from my "Cat
    species in dogz" or "Dog species in catz" pages, read the instructions
    carefully and install it. That will fool the game, and you can then download
    and play with my various species etc.</p>

    <p><b class="big">NOTE for site owners:</b><br>
    please do <b>not</b> directly link to the files or pictures at my site. I
    have no objection to anyone putting my breedz up elsewhere, provided that
    you put an acknowledgement also that they are my work. The same applies to
    my tutorials, although a link instead to my tutorials page would be a better
    idea as I am always in process of updating them.</p>

    <p class="big">Please note that my site has moved to <a
        href="https://boardwalkerz.com/carolyn/" target="_top">Boardwalkerz</a>
    thanks to Sue Briley's generosity.<br>
    I've left a few pages at the Petzwarehouse, with grateful thanks to Abby, so
    that people know where to come for my files. Bless you, Abby, for hosting my
    monster of a site for so long!</p>

    <p id="INFO" class="big"><b>Download problems? Read here</b><br>
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

    <p><b>PLEASE READ IF YOU HAVE DOWNLOAD PROBLEMS<br>
    or my files confuse you: </b><br>
    If you have problems downloading a file from this site... right-click on it
    and choose "save link as" or "save target as" (whichever your browser says),
    follow the dialogue box which opens in order to save it to a place on your
    hard drive (usually the Desktop), then open it afterwards. Please do not
    write to me about any files which "have nothing in them" unless you have
    tried this method.<br>
    The Petz 3, 4 and 5 breedfiles are all sound-stripped. I've produced
    external sounds for all the original breedz as well as most of my "species"
    or "fantasy" breedz so that you can choose whether to download the sounds or
    play with the files mute.</p>

    <p><span class="big"><b>Important Information</b><br>
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br></span>
    Windows XP, Windows 2000 (or NT), Windows ME users, and people who have some
    update to their system that is beyond mine -- if you have some problem with
    my breedz that I cannot duplicate on either my Windows 95 or my husband's
    plain Windows 98 system, then I cannot help you. If I am able to duplicate
    the problem, then there is something wrong with the file that I can (I hope)
    fix and of course I shall do my best to do so. If I am not able to duplicate
    it, then there is nothing wrong with the file and it is some mysterious
    problem related to an incomprehensible alchemy between your operating system
    and/or game and my file so I cannot fix it. Sorry. The only thing I can
    suggest is a possible fix for you to do for yourself; you'll find it <a
        href="/crashingxp/" target="_top">here</a>. Windows XP with SP2 has
    special new quirks, woop-de-doo. WinXP is <b>bleurgh</b> and <b>Vista --
    AAAARGH!!</b> *hugs nice comfy Win95 setup, warts an' all*</p>

    <p>It came to my attention a while ago that there were Petz 5 versions of
    some of my breedz at Nicky's Petzfriends site, and that those versions have
    wrong ID numbers etc. Nicky and I eventually reached an agreement which
    should fix any problems that people may have with this. Read <a
        href="/petzfriendsite/">here</a> if you would like to know more about
    it, and about how to get your pets to breed if you downloaded one of the
    "conversions" from her site.<br>
    Please note that you <b>do not need to convert</b> any of my breedz to Petz
    5, I make them all available for that game myself. I shall not convert
    anyone else's breedz, I do not have the time, but I have "howtos" up for you
    to try or you can ask for help on the various forums.</p>

    <p>Mac users (or anyone else with this problem) if you download files and
    get gibberish appearing in your browser, ending up with a corrupted file
    when you try to save it, try either downloading with a download manager or
    look in your browser's cache and copy it directly from there. The copy
    that's in your cache should not be corrupted.</p>

    <p class="green"><span class="big"><b>What's Happening Here</b><br>
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br></span>
    I checked through this again, and a lot of stuff has changed, so this is the
    latest state of play:</p>

    <p class="green">There's a bunch of odd bits and pieces that I need to
    finish off, but I have no idea when I'll get the time to do so. Foolers for
    all of the games are now available at my Boardwalkerz site.</p>

    <p class="green">The Oddballz-to-petz line -- still got a bunch of
    Transformations to do. I intend to put them together as two or three more
    all-in-one breedz. These will probably be the last "full" breedz I shall
    ever make, plus one breed that I promised years ago and will probably never
    be finished, for someone who has already left the Petz Community 8-}</p>

    <p class="green">I need to finish off the LNZ breakdown chunks, with special
    attention to the Oddballz info which has been sadly neglected. I also need
    to gather together various other little howtos, and the breakdown of a .pet
    and .baby file, and make them as comprehensible as possible (hah!) so y'all
    can fix petz, game-crashes etc.</p>

    <p class="green">I no longer need to fix the oversize-pet corruptions,
    thanks to Nicholas' Tools. Yay for Petza!</p>

    <p class="green">I've continued to tidy up my tutorials pages; I really hope
    that people can find things now. The actual tutorials are mostly written
    some time ago and newer available tools etc (such as Tinker, LNZPro 2, my
    easy-edit kits) have made things easier, so some of the tuts are more
    complicated than they should be, but they are mostly still valid.</p>

    <p class="green">Through lack of time, and because I don't breed or show
    petz, I no longer research 2nd-gen problems, so it's up to all you guys and
    gals to find out any new quirks in that area.</p>

    <p class="green">I also do not, and never shall, make "exclusives" for
    individuals. Everything that I make is downloadable for all. To be honest, I
    cannot understand this modern fashion for exclusivity. My ethos has always
    been to make information and game modifications free for all.</p>

    <p class="green">Real Life and a steady stream of sweet, vulnerable
    foster-cats and kitties clamour for my attention almost constantly. Hexing
    and these games have to come second, and can only be done in small snatches
    of free time. So I don't take breed-making requests any more, I just don't
    have the time. Really, the answer has to be "no" to requests. However,
    anyone can try it nowadays, as there is a choice of several tools, including
    LNZPro and Pet Workshop, as well as the utilities at MK&C, Resource Hacker,
    and my own Easy-edit packages.</p>

    <p class="green">There are lots of good hexers out there on the Internet,
    some of whom are kind-hearted or will do requests, so if you cannot bear to
    try hexing yourself, just ask around the various message-boards and forums.
    Look in my links pages for some forums that you can start with. I know the
    links pages are badly out of date as of December 2006, but I don't have time
    to fix them right now.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p class="big" id="ACK"><b>Acknowledgments</b><br>
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
    I'd like to thank Tom for the wonderful web pages that he maintained at the
    Petzwarehouse for so long, and I'd like to thank Abby of the <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070625152049/http://www.thepetzwarehouse.com/"
        target="_top">PetzWarehouse</a> for her patience and for providing the
    space to store my files for so many years.</p>

    <p class="big">Big thanks also to my pal Sue of <a
        href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321120755/http://boardwalkerz.com/"
        target="_top">Petz Boardwalk</a> for coming to my rescue in the hard
    times, generously mirroring my lummox of a site, and finally hosting the
    whole shebang.</p>

    <p class="big">Thanks to Misty (aka Acid Chaos), for giving me the kick I
    needed to get interested in site making. Of her original design all that is
    left is the calculation of graphic sizes on the breedz pages -- left to
    myself, the graphics would have been all different sizes! Her original
    design was beautiful, but I couldn't see it in my favourite browser so in
    the end it had to go. But I am very grateful for her work, as without it I
    might never have repaired this site when we moved to the new server.</p>
