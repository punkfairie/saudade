      Still brief, the sick kitten is a fair bit better but I'm still being kept
      busy by him and the rest of my little foster-family. So, back to Petz --
      we have version 1.1.2 of Pet Workshop for you on
      <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools page</a> -- small but
      good changes, thanks Nicholas :-) Also I've tweaked my
      <a href="/tutorials/LNZPro2tips/">LNZPro 2 tips</a>. By the way, Babyz
      hexers might like to use it as an alternative to Resource Hacker -- you
      can open the .dll file if you make the dialogue show "choose all files".
      And peeps, don't forget to check out the sites on my
      <a href="/smallislovely/">"small is beautiful" </a>links page, there are
      some real gems there.
    </p>

    <p class="bold">27 June 2005</p>

    <p>
      Just briefly, as I have a sick kitten to deal with at the mo'...
      <a href="/tutorials/LNZPro2tips/">LNZPro 2 tips</a> for people who don't
      know where to edit the breed bitmap, ID number and name. Also some new
      links on my <a href="/smallislovely/">"small is beautiful" </a>links page,
      and an updated url for Jillie's Petz Place on my
      <a href="/links/">main links page.</a>

    <p>
      LNZPro 2! YESSS! LNZPro is a brilliant tool (of course -- look who made
      it!) It edits .pet files as well as your .dog, .cat, .env, .toy, .clo
      files... Go get it from
      <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools page</a>, you know you
      <b>need</b> it :-)
    </p>

    <p class="bold">21 June 2005</p>

    <p>
      Petza, at version 1.4, will trim the size of family-tree-bloated .petfiles
      down to the first 8 generations! You can still see the family tree in Petz
      games, but remember that the rest of the tree will be removed in petz with
      a long lineage. All the features of the earlier versions are still in
      place of course. Go to
      <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools page</a> to grab it.
      Also I have new links on my
      <a href="/smallislovely/">"small is beautiful" </a>links page.

      Petza version 1.3 has been temporarily removed. There were some concerns
      amongst the petz community as regards the family-tree trimmer; Nicholas
      hopes to be able to come up with a solution soon. Meanwhile, the very
      handy version 1.2 is back up for you, on the usual page :-)
    </p>

    <p class="bold">13 June 2005</p>

    <p>
      Hear ye, hear ye!! Petza, at version 1.3, will trim the size of
      family-tree-bloated .petfiles now! Go to
      <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools page</a>
      <b>right away</b>, and save overbloated female petz from future corruption
      :-)<br />
      Also something new for Babyz players, a Teletubbies TV on the
      <a href="/babyz/babyztoyz/">Babyz toyz </a>page.<br />

      <b>now</b>, you know you want to :-)<br />

      I have for you: another big update to Petza, it's at version 1.1 now! Go
      to
      <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools page</a> and grabbie
      grabbie. Some new links on my
      <a href="/smallislovely/">"small is beautiful" </a>links page. And some
      updated info on a couple of my
      <a href="/tutorials/LNZdetails/">"LNZ breakdown chunks" </a>pages. I
      should have mentioned all this yesterday, but Real Life got in the way --
      my little Lydoe was returned to me, the poor little thing had to come back
      from her new home through no fault of her own and she's needed plenty of
      TLC.
    </p>

    <p class="bold">30 May 2005</p>

    <p>
      Just a small update, but important to me :-) Some lovely pictures on my
      <a href="/giftsa4/">May "gifts from friends"</a> page, and some new links
      on my <a href="/smallislovely/">"small is beautiful" </a>links page.
    </p>

    <p class="bold">29 May 2005</p>

    <p>
      A big update to Petza! Go to
      <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools page</a>. Download,
      install and enjoy! Remember to back up all your petz before you start
      fiddling around with them :-)
    </p>

    <p class="bold">25 May 2005</p>

    <p>
      small update to Petza; it's a smaller download and you don't need to unzip
      it. If your browser corrupts the download, then grab the zipped copy. Also
      I've put more explanation on the page which I hope will help people who
      are confused, and links to working .exe files for it. It now works with my
      modified Babyz exe. Go to
      <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools page</a>. Download,
      install and gaze with amazement at the result :-)
    </p>

    <p class="bold">24 May 2005</p>

    <p>
      Petza is now available for Babyz as well as Petz 3, 4, 5! Go to
      <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools page</a>. Download,
      install and adore. The brain-sliders have been re-enabled for small pups
      and kittens; remember that in Petz 5 it's your own fault if you corrupt a
      mother by ageing only some of her litter..<br />

      installing this one!! Also new, from me, is a modified Petz II exe which
      gives brain-slider users more information. It is available
      <a href="/madscientist/">on the mad scientist page</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="bold">19 May 2005 Part 2</p>

    <p>

      it, try it, gasp in amazement and then kiss Nicholas' feet :-)<br />

      3 easy-edit scenes are now also available for

      request, a stripped-down version of my Spinosaurus .lnz on

      Finally, a couple of new links on my "small is lovely" links page; go see,
      they have some interesting stuff :-)
    </p>

    <p class="bold">09 May 2005</p>

    <p>
      Okay, lessee, what've I got for you now... Ah yes, some stuff for Babyz,
      and a demo-fooler for Petz 3. On the
      <a href="/madscientist/">mad Scientist page</a>, you'll find the Petz 3
      demo fooler; you should be able to find all the files that you need, but
      remember to read the readme files carefully. My Babyz
      <a href="/babyz/babyzharem/">Harem Sets page</a> now includes a gold
      sparkly dress; sorry it's so slow getting the sets uploaded, I have a bit
      of a log-jam here with things that I need and want to do.<br />
      <img src="TevynGoldDanceDress.gif" /><br />
      A tutorial with example on my
      <a href="/babyz/babyzedit/">Babyz-specific page</a> for people who are
      having trouble getting crackers from their own edited cracker-boxes to
      show up properly. And my
      <a href="/babyz/babyztoyz/">carrot-treat bag</a> is now ported to babyz;
      my little types love 'em :-)<br />

    <p class="bold">07 May 2005</p>

    <p>
      As before, I'm a bit late writing this What's New -- I keep meaning to
      write it once I have a proper upload done, but I've only got bits and
      pieces up at present, thanks to Real Life getting in the way :-) Anyway,
      for now, On the
      <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools page</a> version 1.1.1
      of Pet Workshop. Also the start of my Babyz Harem clothes, on the
      <a href="/babyz/babyzharem/">Harem Sets page</a>. And before anyone gets
      outraged, it's just some fun dressing-up stuff, and it's fun to watch them
      disco-dancing with jewels in their navels ;-) More to come of course; I
      hope to have more game-foolers up tomorrow for Petz as well as more harem
      clothes for Babyz.
    </p>

    <p class="bold">03 May 2005</p>

    <p>
      I'm a bit late writing this What's New, sorry -- Real Life dragged me from
      the computer just as I was writing it. I do have some updates. On the
      <a href="/madscientist/">Mad Scientist page,</a> I've grouped together
      links to all the game-foolers; we have two new ones, thanks to
      SuperSwampert67. One is
      <a href="/petz/petz1/dogz1fooler/">for Dogz 1</a> -- for which I copied an
      o-old P.F.Magic Dogz 1 page, complete with a little old animated dog, an
      early use of Shockwave bless 'em :-) The other fooler (plus some easy-edit
      playscene kits) is <a href="/petz/petz4/petz4fooler/">for Petz 4</a>. I've
      also tweaked the tutorials pages slightly, removed my "tutorialbits" link
      because I've distributed the info more logically, made it easier to find
      the info on finding a pet's ID, and improved vastly the info on getting
      Petz II runaways back. I did write to tell the requester about that, but
      haven't heard back. If he's reading this and didn't get my email, then I
      say "go check out the
      <a href="/tutorials/PIIRunawaysHome/">PII Runaways Home info </a>." I'd be
      glad to know whether he got his son's pet fixed or not.
    </p>

    <p class="bold">29 April 2005</p>

    <p>
      On the <a href="/madscientist/">Mad Scientist page,</a> For People who are
      having trouble finding Petz 5, a Petz 5 fooler to keep you going until you
      can buy the full game. On the
      <a href="/sounds/soundsorig/">Sounds page, </a>For people with dogz-only
      parts of Petz 3, 4 or 5, there's a bunch of sound files to enable you to
      hear all the sounds for dogz-based "cat" breedz. For everyone who wants to
      hear persian-cat sounds in their dogz game *LOL*, you'll also need the
      persian sounds and the special small "fix"file.
    </p>

    <p class="bold">27 April 2005</p>

    <p>
      Just a couple of things; I've re-jigged the menu a bit in my eternal quest
      to make it easy to find things. I've altered the intro to the
      <a href="/oddballz/oddballzedit/">Oddballz kits pages</a>; I think it's
      now obvious that Players should grab the kits so they can have more fun,
      <b>not just</b> hexers. For Oddballz hexers, information on getting the
      maximum number of individual Transformations in their breedz. For Babyz
      hexers, I've uploaded a pre-prepared BabyzRez.dll in the "Easy Babyz"
      section of the <a href="/babyz/babyzedit/">Babyz Howtos </a>page. This is
      the ultra, <b>ultra</b> easy kit for people who want to use my easy-edit
      method. It's more reliable than Resource Hacker :-)
    </p>

    <p class="bold">26 April 2005</p>

    <p>
      Woah, quite a large update today, something for most people. Pet Workshop
      1.1 is up with some new features! Available as usual from
      <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools page</a>. Also updated
      since last "what's new" are <a href="/giftsa3/">my gifts from friends</a>.
      For Babyz players, <a href="/babyz/babyznew/">four new babes </a>you might
      like. And for Dogz 3, 4 and 5 players, Butterfly Chaser's Great Tree,
      <a href="/specials/collaborations">Team Creation with myself</a>. I'll be
      getting the sounds done soon I hope.<br />

    <p>
      Well, I had loads I wanted to get uploaded this weekend, but Real Life
      jumped at me again. I meant to announce yesterday that a couple of great
      new versions -- Pet Workshop 1.0.9 and LNZPro version 1.3 -- are now
      available from
      <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools page</a>. Also updated
      since last "what's new" are my sisters and babyz links pages. And for
      people who follow my foster-cats' adventures, some new pics etc a new
      update
      <a

    <p>
      Tinker version 1.7.1 is now available from
      <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools page</a>. Bugfixes --
      you can now save toyz properly again -- and a new feature.
    </p>

    <p class="bold">17 April 2005</p>

    <p>
      Tinker version 1.7 is now available from
      <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools page</a>. Bugfixes and
      some new features :-)
    </p>

    <p class="bold">15 April 2005</p>

    <p>
      Not the big update I'd hoped for -- it's been a difficult couple of days.
      But I do have some Babyz stuff; a couple of howtos on the
      <a href="/babyz/babyzedit/">Babyz easy-edit page</a>, they are help with
      getting clothes/toyz to show up separately and How make your baby
      permanently skinny (or fat) Work with Petz files too of course, but they
      are aimed at Babyz hexers. Also four new
      <a href="/babyz/babyznew/">downloadable babyz</a>, including a pair that
      show a radical new way of making hair a little more natural-behaving.<br />
      <img src="Newstyles.gif" />
    </p>

    <p class="bold">13 April 2005 part 2</p>

    <p>
      The alternative Easy Kit files are now available from my
      <a href="/oddballz/oddballzedit/">Oddballz Easy Kits page</a>. Non-hexers
      can have a lot of fun with these, just as much as hexers, and if you have
      an Easy-kit version of Oddballz installed you will be able to download and
      use any Easy-kit files that hexers might want to share :-)
    </p>

    <p class="bold">13 April 2005 part 1</p>

    <p>
      Tinker version 1.6 is now available from
      <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools page</a>. Fixes a
      little problem with the oddballz palette. I forgot to say that yesterday I
      also put the bunny soundfiles on the species sounds page -- previously I
      had them in the zips with my downloadable cotton bunny and breedable
      bunny. Thanks to Minibyte for pointing that out :-)
    </p>

    <p class="bold">12 April 2005 part 2</p>

    <p>
      Updated my
      <a href="/oddballz/oddballzedit/">Oddballz Easy-Edit packages</a> so that
      all filmstrips are external and can be edited with
      <a href="/tools2/">Tinker</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="bold">12 April 2005 part 1</p>

    <p>
      Tinker version 1.5 is now available from
      <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools page</a>. Bugfixes and
      fantastic news for Oddballz fans -- it'll work with the external FLH/FLM
      files in my Easy-edit packages! Three cheers for Nicholas! *grabs Tinker
      and cuddles it*
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>11 April 2005</b><br />
      Yes, "tomorrow" came and went without the promised update -- the keen-eyed
      amongst you, however, will have noticed that I made a large
      <a href="/babyzlinks/">babyz links</a> page, put up some lovely
      <a href="/flowers/">gifts from people </a>which I'm extremely proud to
      have, altered the front page slightly and shifted this "what's new" onto
      its own page plus, for those who care, made a partial update on my Real
      Life

      Yes, I'm slow with the html and checking everything, but I felt it all
      needed doing so everything else has had to wait... We resume our regularly
      scheduled broadcast tomorrow :-)
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>09 April 2005</b><br />
      Whee, all the Oddballz external-lnz breedz are now up at the
      <a href="/oddballz/oddballzedit/">Oddballz Editing page</a>. I'll be
      fixing up the "alternative" lnz files mentioned in the readme files as
      soon as I can, to enable players not to have to swap around the
      Transformation .lnz files too much. Tomorrow though I hope to have
      something for petz and Babyz players.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>08 April 2005</b><br />
      Okay, "tomorrow" slipped a bit, and it's not quite as much of an upload as
      I'd hoped, but I've been doing a lot of groundwork on the Oddballz
      Transformations which should be helpful when I get it all organised, and
      meanwhile there is Honker on the
      <a href="/oddballz/oddballzedit/">Oddballz Editing page</a> along with a
      file for you to grab if you're having trouble getting your edits to show
      up in the Pig transforms. For people who want to make new
      <a href="/babyz/babyztoyz/">babyz toyz</a> from the stuffed man toy, I've
      made him show up on the shelf. That's it for today; the weekend
      <b>should really</b> see the rest of the Oddballz breedz, plus that
      collaboration breed for Petz, plus a special new baby or two for babyz
      players.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>06 April 2005</b><br />
      I got hijacked by the Babyz Community, so this time it's a special set of
      <a href="/babyz/babyzglasses/">babyz glasses</a>, including a
      "do-it-yourself" version. No more at the moment, but the rest of the
      Oddballz easy-edits will go up tomorrow, truly, also I hope to get a
      special collaboration breed for Petz games up before the weekend. You got
      to give me marks for trying, anyway!<br />

      -- Pet Workshop, a public beta of a work still in progress, make sure you
      back up your files before editing of course. At present it edits .dog

      Happy New Year!!<br />
      Today I'm trying to update this site, but don't expect any exciting
      downloads just yet -- all I'm doing is moving things around, a sort of
      "spring clean", LOL, although you might find the updated "important
      information" and "what's happening here" sections on this front page worth
      a read. Got some new info in them you might find interesting. Also I've
      been given a Star Adopter award, which is up on my Gifts pages; thanks,
      Sarah! I should have some new things up for some of you this coming
      weekend. I'm also trying to update my real-life Foster-cats site; this
