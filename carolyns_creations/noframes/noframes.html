    href="Netscape4Installfiles.zip">Netscape Commander 4 (click)</a>. Unzip and
    install Netscape, it won't affect any of your other browsers. Choose to
    install the included cosmo Player if it asks, because then you'll be able to
    play with the Catz 1 <a href="/petz/petz1/dream/">Catz World </a>! Then
    double-click on the Player to install it and you'll be able to play with

    This is an archive of all the items that I have ever hex-edited or converted
    for the various P.F.Magic Petz, Oddballz and Babyz games. It also includes
    my stuff for Petz 5 which was created in 2002 by Studio Mythos and is in the
    same style as the older games. The websites for these games are now gone --
    the new Dogz, Catz etc games which you see at <a
    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061207042930/http://petz.us.ubi.com/"
    target="_top">Ubisoft's Petz </a>site, and the various girly games for
    Nintendo DS at <a
    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090226034054/http://imagine.us.ubi.com/"
    target="_top">their "Babyz.net" </a>site are in no way similar to the
    original Petz etc games and are not covered in my tutorials. I also do not
    have downloads for any Ubisoft games created from 2006 onwards. All that I
    have for you of those later games is my <a href="/petz6/" target="main"
    title="Catz and Dogz 2006">Info Only</a> page, which may be useful for
    anyone wanting to "hex" or modify the PC versions of those games.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b class="big">People with Dogz-only or Catz-only parts of the Petz games
      please read</b><br>
    If you want one of my breedz, <b>please</b> don't ask me to convert between
    dogz and catz games -- instead, download the relevant package from my "Cat
    species in dogz" or "Dog species in catz" pages, read the instructions
    carefully and install it. That will fool the game, and you can then download
    and play with my various species etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b class="big">NOTE for site owners:</b><br>
    please do <b>not</b> directly link to the files or pictures at my site. I
    have no objection to anyone putting my breedz up elsewhere, provided that
    you put an acknowledgement also that they are my work. The same applies to
    my tutorials, although a link instead to my tutorials page would be a better
    idea as I am always in process of updating them.

      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    </span><br>
    Windows XP, Windows 2000 (or NT), Windows ME users, and people who have some
    update to their system that is beyond mine -- if you have some problem with
    my breedz that I cannot duplicate on either my Windows 95 or my husband's
    plain Windows 98 system, then I cannot help you. If I am able to duplicate
    the problem, then there is something wrong with the file that I can (I hope)
    fix and of course I shall do my best to do so. If I am not able to duplicate
    it, then there is nothing wrong with the file and it is some mysterious
    problem related to an incomprehensible alchemy between your operating system
    and/or game and my file so I cannot fix it. Sorry. The only thing I can
    suggest is a possible fix for you to do for yourself; you'll find it <a
    href="/crashingxp/" target="_top">here</a>. Windows XP with SP2 has special
    new quirks, woop-de-doo. WinXP is <b>bleurgh</b> and <b>Vista --
    AAAARGH!!</b> *hugs nice comfy Win95 setup, warts an' all*
  </p>

  <p>
    It came to my attention a while ago that there were Petz 5 versions of some
    of my breedz at Nicky's Petzfriends site, and that those versions have wrong
    ID numbers etc. Nicky and I eventually reached an agreement which should fix
    any problems that people may have with this. Read <a
    href="/petzfriendsite/">here </a>if you would like to know more about it,
    and about how to get your pets to breed if you downloaded one of the
    "conversions" from her site.<br>
    Please note that you <b>do not need to convert</b> any of my breedz to Petz
    5, I make them all available for that game myself. I shall not convert
    anyone else's breedz, I do not have the time, but I have "howtos" up for you
    to try or you can ask for help on the various forums.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mac users (or anyone else with this problem) if you download files and get
    gibberish appearing in your browser, ending up with a corrupted file when
    you try to save it, try either downloading with a download manager or look
    in your browser's cache and copy it directly from there. The copy that's in
    your cache should not be corrupted.

    The Oddballz-to-petz line -- still got a bunch of Transformations to do. I
    intend to put them together as two or three more all-in-one breedz. These
    will probably be the last "full" breedz I shall ever make, plus one breed
    that I promised years ago and will probably never be finished, for someone
    who has already left the Petz Community 8-}
  </p>

  <p class="green">
    I need to finish off the LNZ breakdown chunks, with special attention to the
    Oddballz info which has been sadly neglected. I also need to gather together
    various other little howtos, and the breakdown of a .pet and .baby file, and
    make them as comprehensible as possible (hah!) so y'all can fix petz,
    game-crashes etc.
  </p>

  <p class="green">
    I no longer need to fix the oversize-pet corruptions, thanks to Nicholas'
    Tools. Yay for Petza!
  </p>

  <p class="green">
    I've continued to tidy up my tutorials pages; I really hope that people can
    find things now. The actual tutorials are mostly written some time ago and
    newer available tools etc (such as Tinker, LNZPro 2, my easy-edit kits) have
    made things easier, so some of the tuts are more complicated than they
    should be, but they are mostly still valid.
  </p>

  <p class="green">
    Through lack of time, and because I don't breed or show petz, I no longer
    research 2nd-gen problems, so it's up to all you guys and gals to find out
    any new quirks in that area.
  </p>

  <p class="green">
    I also do not, and never shall, make "exclusives" for individuals.
    Everything that I make is downloadable for all. To be honest, I cannot
    understand this modern fashion for exclusivity. My ethos has always been to
    make information and game modifications free for all.
  </p>

  <p class="green">
    Real Life and a steady stream of sweet, vulnerable foster-cats and kitties
    clamour for my attention almost constantly. Hexing and these games have to
    come second, and can only be done in small snatches of free time. So I don't
    take breed-making requests any more, I just don't have the time. Really, the
    answer has to be "no" to requests. However, anyone can try it nowadays, as
    there is a choice of several tools, including LNZPro and Pet Workshop, as
    well as the utilities at MK&C, Resource Hacker, and my own Easy-edit
    packages.
  </p>

  <p class="green">
    There are lots of good hexers out there on the Internet, some of whom are
    kind-hearted or will do requests, so if you cannot bear to try hexing
    yourself, just ask around the various message-boards and forums. Look in my
    links pages for some forums that you can start with. I know the links pages
    are badly out of date as of December 2006, but I don't have time to fix them
    right now.

    I'd like to thank Tom for the wonderful web pages that he maintained here

    Big thanks also to my pal Sue of <a

    generously mirroring my lummox of a site, and finally hosting the whole
    shebang.

    Thanks to Misty (aka Acid Chaos), for giving me the kick I needed to get
    interested in site making. Of her original design all that is left is the
    calculation of graphic sizes on the breedz pages -- left to myself, the
    graphics would have been all different sizes! Her original design was
    beautiful, but I couldn't see it in my favourite browser so in the end it
    had to go. But I am very grateful for her work, as without it I might never
    have repaired this site when we moved to the new server.
