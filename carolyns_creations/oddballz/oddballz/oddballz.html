        NOTE -- Since the arrival of
        <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Tinker 1.5</a>, editing the "Easy
        kit" filmstrips and customising the whole look of your game is now
        beautifully simple! You can change the whole look of your game and toyz,
        and you can share the results with other Easy kit users :-)

        you need to already have installed before you can use the mouse. Note
        that the oddballz will eat or fall in love with the mouse (depending on
        the particular Oddballz' leanings) just as they would any grubz!

        And here are some different mice that I made using the Catz 1 and Petz 3
        mice .LNZ files as reference. They also need my

        You can find the link to the download site and some info on using LNZPro
        and Tinker here, both of which can be used along with my easy-edit kits
        to customise your own game.

        The "lnz info" pages are a breakdown of all the items which can be put
        into your breedz' lnz, along with information and syntax. The
        Oddballz-specific ones are still not yet written up, but if you browse
        through all the ones for Petz you should get a clear idea of what each
        part does.
