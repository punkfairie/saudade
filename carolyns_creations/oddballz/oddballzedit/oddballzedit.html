  <p><b>Oddballz PLAYERS, you can have more fun with your game!</b><br>
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
    <a href="/oddballz/oddballzplayer/">Go here to download what you
      need</a>.<br>
    Extra fun for your Oddballz gaming -- you don't need to be a hexer to enjoy
    the wackiness! Swap, be zany, and share! When you've installed all the
    files, you can change things in your game just by swapping them around, and
    you can download all those juicy external-file items which the "hexers"
    amongst us make :-)</p>

  <p>.</p>

  <p><b>Oddballz HEXERS, discover the feedom of Easy-edit kits!</b><br>
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
    <a href="/oddballz/oddballzedit2/">Go here to download what you
      need.</a><br>
    You can now customise just about everything in your game, and share the
    results with others including non-hexers! Yay!</p>

  <p>For anyone who finds an .opj file or wants to make them and swap with
    friends, <a href="WinScrambler.zip">here is Ron Tigat's Eggz
      Scrambler</a> for Windows and <a href="MacScrambler.hqx">here is the one
      for Mac</a>. I think that these are the latest versions. The Windows one
    is UOPWD Eggz Scrambler Build 0310 and was created in August 2002, I'm not
    sure of the date and version of the Mac one.</p>
