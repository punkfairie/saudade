  <p><span class="bigger purple"><b>Catz Behaviours for Dogz games</b><br>
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br></span>
    I am supplying the cut down cat-behaviour files that are on this page so
    that people who have only the dogz part of the Petz games can play with my
    catz-based Oddballz-to-petz breedz. I do not wish to convert all of the
    Oddballz-petz to Dogz-based breedz, partly because, at heart, Oddballz are
    more like catz than dogz -- and partly because converting them all would be
    an enormous task.</p>

  <p>However, I did promise some people that I would make it so that they
    could play with Oddballz-petz in their dogz games. So here is a compromise
    that I hope Dogz-games players will accept. Please read the readme texts
    included in the zipfiles carefully; they tell you how to install the
    files.</p>

  <p>These files are only for Petz II upwards; the original Dogz game was
    never part of a full "petz" game, and nor was the original Catz game, so
    there is no way to make the one work with the other's game engine.</p>

  <p><b>NOTE</b> to anyone who thinks that they would be getting the full
    catz games with this kit; this is <b>not</b> the case, even though the game
    is fooled into thinking that the Catz part of Petz is present. There are
    several important items still missing, such as the sounds resources, but you
    don't need those items in order to play with my custom-crafted Oddballz-petz
    :-)</p>

  <p class="big">For Petz 3, 4 or 5 you need to download the relevant Basic
    Cat Behaviours file for that game (sorry it's a large file) and then you
    need to download whichever of the small cut-down cat rez files goes with
    your version of the game.<br>
    For Petz 4 and 5, download the bunny for your game version also -- you'll
    need it.<br>
    <a href="p4originalbunny.zip">Bunny file for Petz 4</a><br>
    <a href="p5originalbunny.zip">Bunny file for Petz 5</a><br>
    For Petz II, there is just the single large download.</p>

  <p><span class="big">NOTE: These zips contain .DLL files. .DLL files need to
    be "un-hidden".</span><br>
    Windows, by default, has files of this type "hidden" -- presumably as some
    kind of safety feature, but in your case you need to see them. So if you
    cannot see them on your machine, open My Computer or Windows Explorer,
    choose View and Options or Tools and Folder Opetions, and then under View
    make sure that "Show all files" or "show hidden files and folders is ticked.
    While you're about it, un-tick "Hide MS-DOS file extensions" or "Hide
    extensions", because that's a nuisance too. <a href="/carolyns_creations/reassociate/">Click

  <p><span class="big">For people who have trouble understanding my
    instructions, here's an example of how it works:</span><br>
    I'll assume it's Dogz 5 and you want the game fooled into playing Catz 5
    breedz. Okay, from this Catz in Dogz page, you will need to download the
    "Basic Cat behaviours for Petz 4 and Petz 5 (4.8 megabytes)" file which will
    download as Catbehaviours_c4c5.zip, the "Small cut-down Catz Rez file for
    Petz 5" file which downloads as Rez_c5.zip, and the "Original Bunny for Petz
    5".</p>

  <p>Unzip the Catbehaviours_c4c5.zip file into the root directory of your
    game -- where the Petz 5.exe is. This is wherever you installed the game. If
    you didn't choose your own place for installing the game, that would
    probably be</p>

  <p>C:\Program Files\UBI Soft\Studio Mythos\Petz 5</p>

  <p>Everything should then go into the right places. You only have to worry
    about shuffling stuff around if it doesn't. Then unzip the Rez_c5.zip into
    your game's Resource directory. If you didn't choose your own place for
    installing the game, that would probably be</p>

  <p>C:\Program Files\UBI Soft\Studio Mythos\Petz 5\Resource</p>

  <p>Then make a directory off the Resource one and rename it Catz. So you
    would now have this:</p>

  <p>C:\Program Files\UBI Soft\Studio Mythos\Petz 5\Resource\Catz</p>

  <p>Unzip the bunny into that directory and of course all your catz breedz --
    any breedfiles which you download that are .cat files -- need to go in
    there.</p>

  <p>.</p>
