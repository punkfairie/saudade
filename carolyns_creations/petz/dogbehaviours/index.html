        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br></span>
    I am supplying the cut down dog-behaviour files that are on this page so
    that people who have only the catz part of the Petz games can play with my
    dogz-based fantasy and species breedz. I do not wish to convert all of my
    Dogz-based specials to the catz games, largely because converting them all
    would take too much time.</p>

    <p>However, I get a lot of requests from people who are keen to play with my
    specials, so here is a compromise that I hope Catz-games players will
    accept. Please read the readme texts included in the zipfiles carefully;
    they tell you how to install the files.</p>

    <p>These files are only for Petz II upwards; the original Dogz game was
    never part of a full "petz" game, and nor was the original Catz game, so
    there is no way to make the one work with the other's game engine.</p>

    <p>NOTE to anyone who thinks that they would be getting the full dogz games
    with this kit; this is not the case, even though the game is fooled into
    thinking that the Dogz part of Petz is present. There are several important
    items still missing, such as the sounds resources, but you don't need those
    items in order to play with my custom-crafted fantasies and species :-)</p>

    <p class="big">For Petz 3, 4 or 5 you need to download the relevant Basic
    Dog Behaviours file (sorry it's a large file) and then you need to download
    whichever of the small cut-down dogz rez files goes with your version of the
    game.<br>
    For Petz 4 and 5, download the pig also.<br>
    <a href="p4originalpig.zip">Pig file for Petz 4</a><br>
    <a href="p5originalpig.zip">Pig file for Petz 5</a><br>
    For Petz II, there is just the single large download.</p>

    <p><span class="big">NOTE: These zips contain .DLL files. .DLL files need to
    be "un-hidden".</span><br>
    Windows, by default, has files of this type "hidden" -- presumably as some
    kind of safety feature, but in your case you need to see them. So if you
    cannot see them on your machine, open My Computer or Windows Explorer,
    choose View and Options, and then under View make sure that "Show all files"
    is ticked. While you're about it, un-tick "Hide MS-DOS file extensions",
    because that's a nuisance too.</p>

    <p><span class="big">For people who have trouble understanding my
    instructions, here's an example of how it works:</span><br>
    I'll assume it's Catz 5 and you want the game fooled into playing Dogz 5
    breedz. Okay, from this Dogz in Catz page, you will need to download the
    "Basic Dog behaviours for Petz 4 and Petz 5 (4.3 megabytes)" file which will
    download as Dogbehaviours_c4_c5.zip, the "Small cut-down Dogz Rez file for
    Petz 5" file which downloads as Rez_d5.zip, plus you'll need to go and get
    the Pig breed.</p>

    <p>Unzip the Dogbehaviours_c4_c5.zip file into the root directory of your
    game -- where the Petz 5.exe is. This is wherever you installed the game. If
    you didn't choose your own place for installing the game, that would
    probably be</p>

    <p>C:\Program Files\UBI Soft\Studio Mythos\Petz 5</p>

    <p>Everything should then go into the right places. You only have to worry
    about shuffling stuff around if it doesn't. Then unzip the Rez_d5.zip into
    your game's Resource directory. If you didn't choose your own place for
    installing the game, that would probably be</p>

    <p>C:\Program Files\UBI Soft\Studio Mythos\Petz 5\Resource</p>

    <p>Then make a directory off the Resource one and rename it Dogz. So you
    would now have this:</p>

    <p>C:\Program Files\UBI Soft\Studio Mythos\Petz 5\Resource\Dogz</p>

    <p>Unpack the pig into that directory and of course all your dogz breedz --
    any breedfiles which you download that are .dog files -- need to go in
    there.</p>

    <p>.</p>
