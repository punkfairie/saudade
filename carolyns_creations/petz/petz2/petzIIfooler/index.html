    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

  <p><a href="PetzIIdemo.zip">The Petz II demo, unpacked for those who cannot
    install</a><br>
    This is the DogzII and CatsII demos, both unpacked and installed into a
    folder called PetzII and then zipped up for download. It is here to help
    people with XP or other operating systems that tend to have problems with
    old game installers -- or for people who, like myself, hate automatic
    installers anyway.</p>

  <p class="big"><b>The Petz II fooler</b><br>
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

  <p><a href="PetzIIdemoFooler.zip">The fooler</a>.<br>
    Please follow the included instructions carefully.</p>

  <p>works for XP also, but on that OS unless you download Nicholas' Petza
    (find his url on my Nicholas' tools page) you will be unable to adopt new
    petz.<br>
    For those who don't use Nicholas' Petza, and need them for the fooler
    petz:<br>
    <a href="GreatdanepII.zip">The Petz II Great Dane -- unpack into Dogz
      folder</a><br>
    <a href="SiamesepII.zip">The Petz II Siamese -- unpack into catz folder</a>
  </p>

  <p>NOTE: if you installed the Petz II demo files from Daniel's site, and you
    use the shortcut to start the game, it will probably still start in demo
    mode even with my fooler in place. The best thing to do is to delete the
    shortcut and then right-click on the .exe and drag-and-drop a new shortcut
    onto your desktop. Thanks to SuperSwampert67 for the heads-up!</p>

  <p>Since Daniel's site went down, it's harder to find the original backup
    breedz etc. So I have them here in a few zips:<br>
    <a href="PIIoriginalCatz.zip">The original Catz breedz</a><br>
    <a href="PIIoriginalCatzDownloadables.zip">The original extra Catz
      breedz</a><br>
    (these extras were once downloadable from the official site)<br>
    <a href="PIIoriginalDogz.zip">The original Dogz breedz</a><br>
    <a href="PIIoriginalDogzDownloadables.zip">The original extra Dogz
      breedz</a><br>
    (these extras were once downloadable from the official site)</p>

  <p>And here are some other backup files that you might like to have in your
    game...<br>
    <a href="PIIOriginalToyz.zip">The original Toyz</a><br>
    <a href="PIIoriginalWallpaper.zip">The original Wallpapers</a></p>

  <p>And for people who have trouble finding them elsewhere on my site, here
    are a bunch of required files to go with the fooler<br>
