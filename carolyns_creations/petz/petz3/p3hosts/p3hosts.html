      <p>
        My thanks to Carol, aka Minibyte, for converting my Petz 4 versions to
        Petz 3 -- and for re-kindling my interest so that I made them look right
        in the closet at last!
      </p>

      <p>
        Please note -- these are the Hosts, exactly as they were made by the
        game's creators. They were of course never intended to have a "normal"
        petz life in the game, without their special clothes. I wanted you to
        have the <b>real</b> Hosts, so I made no changes. If you don't like
        Bear's back legs, or Wyatt's ears and wrists, or the way Peg and Pharaoh
        look, then I suggest that you either adopt a different pet instead or
        always keep their proper clothes on.<br />
        Also I am providing an alternative Peg, because I gather that in some
        people's games Peg does not have the grey wrist-cuffs that she does in
        mine. So you get to choose :-)
