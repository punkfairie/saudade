    Click picture or name to download.</p>

    <p><b>This page contains any playscenes or special items to go with
    playscenes that I make for the Petz 3 game. Unless otherwise stated, they
    are for the English-language version; I do intend to make them for the
    International version also, and when I do they will be clearly
    labelled.</b></p>

    <p><b>NOTE: if you are trying to use my carrycase patch but can't see any
    .dll files in your game's Resource directory, then they are "hidden" and you
    need to un-hide them. Open either "My Computer" or "Windows Explorer" and,
    from the "View" drop-down menu, choose "Options". Now in the View pane of
    the dialogue box that pops up, choose "show all files" and not "hide files
    of these types". Click "OK", then go to that directory and you'll see the
    .dll files just fine. Make a copy of any file that you intend to patch, as
    these are important files and you might want your original back
    again!</b></p>

    <p><b>The Secret Wood is now finished and available complete for you to
    download! It will look best if you download the special Carry-case with
    mice, and the toyz -- and I strongly recommend that you download the sounds
    also. Click on various things, such as the knot-hole by the lion's nose, for
    some little surprises, and have fun with the birdie-house and Scarab
    (dung-beetle). You can pick them up and move them around the place. The
    beetle does a dung-beetle's job of clearing up dirt, and the birdie-house
    keeps time for you. Oh, and there is a shelf in the bower above the
    Lion.<br>
    I hope you enjoy this scene and find it as magical as I do. I shall be
    putting together my notes and filmstrip bitmaps into a tutorial to help
    other people make their own carry-case and playscene.</b></p>
