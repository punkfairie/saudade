  This page is intended as a service for petz 3 fans who are now finding that
  all playscene sites are inactive. I am putting it up with the special
  permission of Abby, who hosts my site, as there seems to be a definite need
  for the service. It contains playscenes made by other people -- <b>NOT</b>
  myself -- for the Petz 3 game. The major creators of most Petz 3 playscenes
  were Alexa of the old Playscene Paradise and Birgit of the old PetzGallery.
  Birgit was an amazingly active person in the great Petz 3 days, and she was
  the only other person I know of apart from myself to figure out the existence
  and importance of ID numbers. One of the best things that she did was to
  create many unusual playscenes from scratch and help others to do so as well,
  including Alexa. Alexa, as well as making some great playscenes, ran the
  marvellous "Jester's Playscene Paradise", which included some useful
  information about the scenes. Terri, of Terri's Petz, and Lyrra of Pride
  Kennels and Cattery both made marvellous backgrounds which Birgit turned into
  scenes.<br>
  <b>Exciting news for fans of Lyrra's work!</b> <a
  href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040810234103/http://www.cyclopsstudio.com/Pride/index.htm"
  target="_top">Pride K&C</a> has re-opened! It's Petz 5 only, but already Lyrra
  is starting to breed petz for adoption. It'll be great to see how the re-born
  site develops :-) I'll be putting the last of her Petz 3 scenes up here soon
  -- thanks, Lyrra!<br>
  I have been unable to trace or contact the other creators, as all the contact
  addresses appear to be inoperative. If anyone sees their work up here and
  wants it taken down, please tell me so; also if I have attributed one of the
  scenes wrongly.<br>
  When the creators altered the sounds enormously, there was no point in trying
  to make smaller patchfiles, but wherever possible I've reduced the downloads
  by making patches. I've checked all the patches, and the scenes that they
  create, in my own game and they work fine for me. There's no point in you
  writing to me about any bugs or glitches that may occur in the game for you
  with these scenes, as they are not my playscenes.<br>
  Unless otherwise stated, the scenes are for the English-language version; any
  that I find eventually for an International version will be uploaded also if I
  have the space, and when I do they will be clearly labelled.

    target="_top">Pride Kennels and Cattery</a>, and Birgit. It's best if you
    have the official download of the snowball toy in your game. This download
    is in the form of a patchfile; you need the original P.F.Magic Snow Scene
    to create it.

      Egypt, also kown as "Nile in Egypt".
    </a><br>
    By "Tabi's SBAC". This scene comes with its own "tropical bug" toy which
    should be put in the toyz directory. It also works best if you
    <b>already</b> have my <a href="/petz/petz3/p3toyz/" target="_top">Dung
    Beetle</a> toy in your game. My Dung Beetle is a blue Scarab, very
    Egyptian :-)

    This scene looks best if you have the Red Toy Car in your game.

      Farm at Dawn
    </a><br>
    By Alexa and Birgit. Has its own internal sounds; extra sounds done by
    Birgit.<br>
    Alexa said: "Yes, ANOTHER farm scene! I made this one manipulating several
    graphics and photos (all my sunrise/sunset pictures in scenes are from my
    missions trip to Haiti!) -- when I saw this image of a farm, I just HAD to
    make it into a scene! Listen to the sounds of daybreak in this beautiful new
    scene!" Birgit said: "This is the Farm at Dawn Scene of Alexa from Playscene
    Paradis which you perhaps allready know, but with some new more 'farm like'
    sounds"

      The Forest.
    </a><br>
    By Birgit. To quote her: "This was the first 'not official' playscene, the
    first one that was not made by PF.Magic. Have a little walk with your petz
    to the forest. Let them play on this peaceful place with a lot of birds and
    butterflies. And calm them, when they hear suddenly a bear roar out of the
    forest - the bears never come out..." She gave special thanks to Terri for
    her help in testing the scene.<br>
    Contains its own internal sounds.
