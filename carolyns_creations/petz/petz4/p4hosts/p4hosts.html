        <b>Petz 4 Hosts Adoptable With Clothing For All P4 Petz</b><br />

        Click photo or name to download.<br />
        Please note -- these are the Hosts, exactly as they were made by the
        game's creators. They were of course never intended to have a "normal"
        petz life in the game, without their special clothes. I wanted you to
        have the
        <b>real</b> Hosts, so I made no changes. If you don't like Bear's back
        legs, or Wyatt's ears and wrists, or the way Peg and Pharaoh look, then
        I suggest that you either adopt a different pet instead or always keep
        their proper clothes on.<br />
        The "modified" clothes which you can download for Misha, Peg, Ringmaster
        Bailey and Wyatt were fixed up by Minibyte to work on petz other than
        the original; for instance, the Misha Modified files make it so that the
        cuffs show on catz, and the Wyatt modified spurs rectify the Monster
        Dog-chasing Effect. I have given these clothes their own on-shelf
        filmstrips, and they overwrite my originals.<br />
        Also I am providing an alternative Peg, because I gather that in some
        people's games Peg does not have the grey wrist-cuffs that she does in
        mine. So you get to choose :-)
