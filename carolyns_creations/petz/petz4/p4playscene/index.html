    Yes, I know that in Real Life, goldfish are supposed to be freshwater fish.
    The ones I "liberated" from the goldfish bowl are ambiguous virtual types
    and can enjoy salt water :-)</b></p>

  <p>NOTE: if you are trying to use my carrycase patch but can't see any .dll
    files in your game's Resource directory, then they are "hidden" and you need
    to un-hide them. Open either "My Computer" or "Windows Explorer" and, from
    the "View" drop-down menu, choose "Options". Now in the View pane of the
    dialogue box that pops up, choose "show all files" and<b>not</b> "hide files
    of these types". Click "OK", then go to that directory and you'll see the
    .dll files just fine. Make a copy of any file that you intend to patch, as
    these are important files and you might want your original back again!</p>

  <p>The Petz 4 version of the Secret Wood is now available complete for you
    to download. It will look best if you download the special Carry-case with
    mice, and the toyz -- and I strongly recommend that you download the sounds
    also. Click on various things, such as the knot-hole by the lion's nose, for
    some little surprises, and have fun with the birdie-house and Scarab
    (dung-beetle). You can pick them up and move them around the place. The
    beetle does a dung-beetle's job of clearing up dirt, and the birdie-house
    keeps time for you. Oh, and there is a shelf in the bower above the
    Lion.<br>
    I hope you enjoy this scene and find it as magical as I do. I shall be
    putting together my notes and filmstrip bitmaps into a tutorial to help
    other people make their own carry-case and playscene. The scene-editing part
    will probably not be as interesting to petz 4 people, given that there is a
    playscene editor for Petz 4, but perhaps the part about toyz and the
    Carry-case will be.</p>
