    These are the very few clothes that I've made for the Petz 5 game. I don't
    have a great interest in making petz clothes, mainly because there have
    always been a lot of people out there making great stuff pretty much since
    the game first came out. But there were a couple of things that people
    wanted to know how to do, and here they are. They show up separately on the
    shelf with rather different graphics; although those on-shelf graphics don't
    look anything like the clothes themselves, you should be able to see which
    ones are mine.</p>
