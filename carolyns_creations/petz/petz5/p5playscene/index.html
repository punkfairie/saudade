    Click picture or name to download.</p>

  <p><b>This page contains any playscenes that I may hex for the Petz 5 game;
    I don't make scenes with the game's editor, because there are people who
    make much better ones that way than I can, but on occasion I may want to
    alter one of the game's original scenes. When I do, I'll post it
    here.</b></p>

  <p>The Petz 5 version of the Secret Wood is now available complete for you
    to download. It will look best if you download the carrycase Skin from my <a href="/carolyns_creations/petz/petz5/p5skinz/">skins page</a>, and the toyz -- and I
    strongly recommend that you download the sounds also. Click on various
    things, such as the knot-hole by the lion's nose, for some little surprises,
    and have fun with the birdie-house and Scarab (dung-beetle). You can pick
    them up and move them around the place. The beetle does a dung-beetle's job
    of clearing up dirt, and the birdie-house keeps time for you. Oh, and there
    is a shelf in the bower above the Lion.<br>
    I hope you enjoy this scene and find it as magical as I do.<br>

    This is actually an easy-edit kit, so take care to follow the included
    instructions. I have made the backdrops 256-colour to make a smaller
    download, and I have altered the daytime backdrop to the Petz 3 or Petz 4
    one for nostalgia freaks like myself. If you want the Adoption Centre
    birdsong, <a href="SoundsForP5playscenes.zip">download this file.</a></p>

    Petz 5 AdoptionGone Editor-created playscene

    This is my one and only Editor-created playscene, which is really my test
    scene created to see what could and couldn't be done with the Editor. I
    thought it turned out kind of fun, so here it is :-)</p>
