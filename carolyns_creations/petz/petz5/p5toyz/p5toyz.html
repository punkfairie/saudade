    These are the few toyz that I've either made or altered to have show up in
    the carrycase for the Petz 5 game.<br>
    For people who are worried about the necessary Registry entry for some of
    the following toyz, please click <a
      href="/tutorials/RegistryHowto/">here</a>, <b>NOTE</b> that this is just
    a howto to explain the use of Regedit if you've downloaded one of my
    non-overwriting toyz! But now that we have our National Treasure -- Nicholas
    -- why not instead download Tinker? Go to my Nicholas' Tools page for <a
      href="/specials/nicholastools/">a link to his site</a> and some tips on
    using his utilities... Once you've downloaded it, use Tinker's File, Modify
    Carrying case, feature.</p>

      These will overwrite the towel and sponge from the Salon scene, so
      put your originals somewhere safe. Once taken out of the case, they
      cannot be put back. If you want to remove them from a scene, close
      the game, move the two toys to a temporary directory, then open the
      game. You can then close the game and put them back in the toyz
      directory.

        Mint Bottle
      </a><br>
      This Mint drink is a brand-new toy for Petz 5.<br>
      It was hexed from the Milk Bottle and is intended as an example for
      a tutorial. It shows up slightly differently on the shelf simply
      because I changed the colour of some pixels in the filmstrip, in a
      similar way to that mentioned in my "simple filmstrip editing" for
      PII, 3 and 4. But if you want to try the same thing, be warned --
      the method results are not predictable in Petz 5. Editing spr files
      by hand is tortuous; you're best using a special SPR-editing tool
      for the job.
