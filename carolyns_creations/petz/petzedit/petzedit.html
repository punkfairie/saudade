        NOTE: Some files that we hexers want to edit are .DLL files. Windows, by
        default, has files of this type "hidden" -- presumably as some kind of
        safety feature, but in our case we need to see them. So if you cannot
        see them on your machine, open My Computer or Windows Explorer, choose
        View and Options, and then under View make sure that "Show all files" is
        ticked. While you're about it, un-tick "Hide MS-DOS file extensions",
        because that's a nuisance too.

        <b id="NEW">Where to find latest "Howto"s etc</b><br />
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      </p>

      <p class="big">
        Usually the newest items are at the top of the relevant section --
        Petfiles (for editing the actual pet files), Breedz main (for major
        breedz tutorials), Breedz info (for important information -- variations,
        2nd-gens, etc), Breedz bits (for all the odds and ends, such as ears and
        tails etc), Copy/Pasties, Scene/toy/clo (for scenes, toyz, clothing, and
        Doors-and-mice easy-edit packages and "howto"s). Some things are a
        little different, though...
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="big"
          >Go to <a href="/tutorials/LNZdetails/">my LNZ breakdown chunks</a
          ><br />
          for my latest delvings into the guts of hexing.</span
        ><br />
        will always contain my latest information on the .lnz files as and when
        I have the time to write my notes as clearly as possible for you<br />

        <span class="big"
          >Go to <a href="/tutorials/tutorials/">my main tutorial page</a><br />
          for the stuff that doesn't fit anywhere or is relevant to other games
          also,</span
        ><br />
        such as how to fix some problems in ResHacked files. This will always
        contain my latest tips and bits of information about everything else I
        can think of, which doesn't fit neatly in specific Babyz, Petz or
        Oddballz tutorials pages, as and when I think of it or have the time to
        write it down for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="big">NOTE 1:</span> You can use the information that's in
        my hexing tutorials for Petz 4 to help you to hex-edit in Petz 5. The
        files are basically the same, with only a few minor differences which I
        cover in my converting "howto". I promise you, you don't need fresh
        tutorials for Petz 5, although I have done my best to update all my
        older ones anyway. All the newer Petz "howtos" are for Petz 5 as well as
        the earlier games -- except for filmstrip editing. In Petz 5 the
        filmstrips need to be split into individual frames, which means that
        filmstrip-based toyz editing and making clothes show up on the shelf as
        objects not already somewhere in the game is not a sane thing to do by
        hand in Petz 5. You need a special tool such as
        <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Tinker</a> for that.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="big">NOTE 2:</span> Hex-painting and the creating of hexed
        litterz is usually -- and up until I released info on petfile editing
        was always -- done by hex-editing a breedfile without renaming it, and
        adopting pets from the edited breed. If you want to "hex-paint" by
        editing an individual pet, then that seems like a lot of effort for very
        little return -- but if you want to do it, take a look at one of my
        advanced "howtos" on pet editing, in the "petfiles" section of this
        page. Or, as of the year 2005, grab LNZPro from my "Nicholas' Tools"
        page -- you can edit pet files with that now.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="big">NOTE 3:</span> Several of my breed-hexing "howto"s
        contain example breedz. These breedz just happen to be the ones that I
        was checking my facts with as I wrote the relevant tutorial, so I popped
        them into the zip. I usually work with Petz 3 (it's fast to load) or
        Petz 4 (it has good error messages and is fairly quick to load), so the
        breedfiles are likely to be for one of those games. You are hexers, or
        else you wouldn't be interested in my "howto"s and tutorials, would you?
        So my theory was that if you want to see my results in action, you can
        easily either copy the .lnz into the appropriate breed in your chosen
        version of the game, or you can convert the breed to that version for
        your own use. It appears that this has simply muddled people; sorry
        about that. I've been intending to convert all of them, therefore, and
        post them on the
        <a href="/petz/tutbreedz/"> "tutorial examples" </a>page. This is very
        low on my list of priorities just now, though!

        <span class="big">NOTE 1:</span> You will notice in various places I say
        that Petz 5 SPR filmstrip files are not editable. Individually, by hand,
        this is true; the filmstrips have to be chopped into individual frames
        for editing, and they are even more difficult and time-consuming to
        split apart by hand than the filmstrip-sections of earlier games. I have
        not yet written up a "howto" for it -- and now I never shall, because
        there is no point, LOL! Tinker is now available for the task, available
        from my "Nicholas' tools" page, and wannabe filmstrip editors can make a
        whole range of great toyz etc without the drudgery :-) Really all my
        filmstrip-editing tutorials have now become redundant, useful only to
        hexing purists and historians... They will have served their purpose in
        filling the gap while no tool was available, and in giving the
        programmers Jonathan Grinshpan (of Oddballz Eggz Scrambler fame) and
        Nicholas (of Tinker fame) handy information for tool-making.

        NOTE: As from the middle of 2005, we have had the brilliant LNZPro,
        available from my Nicholas' Tools pages. With this, you can open a pet
        file and edit the .LNZ sections to your heart's content, adding and
        removing ballz without having to think about the checksum, exactly as
        you would edit a breedfile. Some other things are editable in a petfile
        with it also. Most of what's in the tutorials in this section was
        written pre-LNZPro so, although the info is still valid it's mostly just
        being kept online here for the interested few.

        <b>Note 1:</b> If you play with a pet in Petz 5 you can not play with it
        in Petz 4 or 3 again. Petz 5 puts extra data into a petfile, and we
        would need to alter checksums in order to even try removing that.
        <span class="normal"
          >Soon we may have a tool to do precisely that, and then maybe there
          will be more "corruptions" that we can fix. But by hand, for now, the
          only thing that can we can do is to "clone" your pet from the data
          within it, either directly into another adopted pet via LNZPro or into
          a breedfile and re-adopt it as a puppy or kitten from the Petz 3 or
          Petz 4 Adoption centre. It will lose its memory and history, but the
          body will be your pet's. You can even pop your original pet's
          personality/genetics into the new petfile, although out of
          consideration for the new pet I'd be inclined to do this in a
          <b>copy</b> of the new pet. And no, I haven't got a "howto" up on how
          to do this; it's complicated "surgery" and I've still got to find a
          way of explaining it.<br />

          games. Note that, since this tutorial was written, Resource Hacker
          became usable and it swept the newer hexing community by storm. The
          trouble with this is that, if you are trying to convert a ResHacked
          breed, it's no longer so simple to do it in a hex editor, because
          Resource Hacker moves things around inside the file when it compiles
          and saves. If the ones you want to convert have been "ResHacked", then
          your best bet is either to copy out the .lnz sections and any bitmaps,
          and make an overwriting breed using my External-LNZ breedz, or to get
          ResHacker yourself and become familiar with its use. I do not do
          Resource Hacker tutorials, although I do have hints on odd things such
