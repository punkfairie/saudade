          ><b>2006 and later Catz, Dogz and Horsez games</b><br />
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
          As of late 2006 and beyond... Just a note to anyone who potters along
          to Petz.com or Babyz.net and sees the new games that were released
          recently.<br
        /></span>
        Most of you already knew that a bunch of virtual life games have been
        released by UbiSoft since 2006, for various consoles and for the PC.
        Hamsterz Life, Hamsterz 2 and Bunnyz are apparently only for the
        Nintendo DS, Horsez and Horsez 2 are released for NDS and PS2 as well as
        for PC, and there are some wildlife "petz" games also for the NDS
        centered around Tigerz and Dolphinz. various Catz and Dogz games have
        been released for mobile phone, Gameboy Advance, NDS, PS2, Wii and PC.
        Although most of these would be playable and, presumably, moddable on
        the PC using emulators, it's the native PC versions that I'm talking
        about here. If anyone wants to mod, or hex, the NDS or mobile phone
        versions of the games you'll find very active modding communities
        amongst the emulator scene. There is also a PS2 emulator for anyone who
        wants to try that, and there may well be a modding community for PS2
        games, but I don't believe that there is any way as yet to play a Wii
        game on an emulator.

          >Although they are named Catz and Dogz or Catz 2 and Dogz 2, the
          latest "Petz" games for Windows are not really part of the Petz series
          we know and love.</span
        ><br />
        They are not really a "Petz 6" although for convenience people have
        referred to them that way; the first two were also known as Catz 2006
        and Dogz 2006 for a while. There are many differences between these
        latest games and the ones that we have so far enjoyed, the most obvious
        being that the catz and dogz are 3D and that you have to earn points, or
        coins, to get even the basics that your pet will need. I'm sure a lot of
        people will enjoy the games, but they are not a part of the original
        series and you will not be able to import your petz from Petz 5 or
        earlier. If you enjoy these games, you might like to check out

        As regards modifying the games, however, things have been made easy
        enough for us "hexers" apart from the 3D models. The files used by the
        game are:
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>LUA, INI,</b> and <b>TXT</b> files all of which are text files which
        can be edited in Notepad.<br />
        You'd have to get used to what all the various column headers and key
        words mean, but there's no harm in experimenting -- so long as you keep
        backups of everything of course. The saved-game files, which is where
        your pets are stored, are .sav files, also just text files, which can be
        edited. They are stored in your<br />
        C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Ubisoft\Catz (or
        Catz2)<br />
        folder or<br />
        C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Ubisoft\Dogz (or
        Dogz2).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>TGA</b> files which are a recognisable format for most paint
        programs.
      </p>

      <p><b>WAV</b> and <b>MP3</b> files which are editable sounds.</p>

      <p>
        <b>DDS</b> files, which are actually editable with the correct tools.
        They can easily be edited using a plug-in which works with either Paint
        Shop Pro or Photoshop, available for free from
        <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/">Nvidia's</a> site -- the is
        dds.8bi<br />
        http://developer.nvidia.com/docs/IO/1176/ATT/dds.8bi
      </p>

      <p>
        GR2 files, which are "Granny 3D" files. These are not so easy to edit
        and are, in a way, the 3D "bones" of the game. Of course anyone who has
        the Granny 3D SDK would be able to edit them, but that's beyond the
        pocket of most of us I'd have thought! I have heard rumours that there
        is a Milkshape plug-in that allows these to be edited, but if not there
        is at least a tool that allows them to be viewed, obtainable for free
        from
        <a href="http://www.radgametools.com/gramain.htm">the Granny 3D site</a
        ><br />
        <b
          >Update as of mid-2008 -- there is now a free way to extract the GR2
          files so that they can be edited in a 3D modelling program. A close
          friend of mine called Topper Carson has the games and he found that
          there are some amazing people who have been picking away at the Gr2
          files which so many games use these days. For useful tools and info
          pop along to the
          <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111230075015/http://gr2decode.altervista.org/index.html"
            >"Decode Gr2"</a
          >
          site. So theoretically you should be able to modify anything that you
          wish in these games.</b

          >The Horsez game, as with Catz 2006 and Dogz 2006 and beyond, is not a
          real part of the Petz series. You're supposed to care for your chosen
          horse as well as enter it for shows and have some adventures with it,
          and the environment is a 3D one. For anyone who has the game and wants
          to edit it, the graphics are in the form of editable .tga files which
          you should be able to edit in a reasonable paint package, and the
          "bones" of it are in the form of .nmo files which will have been
          created via Virtools. If you have
          <a

            >Virtools </a
          >of course you'll be able to edit them. I don't know if there is a
          cheaper utility for editing such things, but if you're keen you could
          have a look around Google. The saved-game files are in a directory off
          the Horsez one, called Save, and the files in there are .txt files and
          therefore should be easy to edit. You'd have to get used to what all
          the various column headers and key words mean, but there's no harm in
          experimenting -- so long as you keep backups of everything of
          course.</b

        <b
          >Babyz players, the only new games available for you from Ubisoft now
          seem to be only for the NDS. So far there is "Imagine Babies" (also
          called "Imagine Babyz" in the US) and possibly due for release in
          September 2008, "Imagine Baby Club". The first one is probably closer
          to the original Babyz experience, but in my opinion neither seems like
          a good replacement. They are part of the extremely girly Imagine
          series for NDS<br />
          A footnote for Babyz players -- there is a new game out called "Bratz
          Babyz", which starts up with a "Babyz.exe", which you might stumble
          across when looking for updates etc. As far as I know, it is not a
          UbiSoft game and it is certainly not in any way a new kind of Babyz
          game, plus the Babyz.exe will not work with your old favourite babyz
          game.</b

          >I doubt that I'll be editing any of these newer PC games. Even apart
          from the fact that they aren't likely to work under my beloved Win 95,
          I don't really have the time even to play these days, and as for my
          skill in editing graphics, well... let's just say I'm "graphically
          challenged", LOL. Of course I'd have no trouble cheating in the catz
          and dogz games, as the saved-game (i.e. pet) files are just LUA files
          -- in other words, they are editable in Notepad.</b

          >For people who are interested in such things, since 2006 the rather
          complex ownership of the games is as follows. The Petz titles are now
          trademarks owned by "Ubisoft Entertainment". The mobile phone versions
          of Petz, Catz and Dogz have been released by Gameloft. The DS Catz
          games were developed by Powerhead Games while the DS and GBA Dogz
          games and the Catz GBA game are copyright to MTO Inc. For the Wii and
          PS2 the Dogz and Catz games are copyright to YUKEâ€™S Co. as well as
          Ubisoft. For the PC, the Dogz and catz games were developed by
          ImaginEngine which is a division of Foundation 9 Entertainment.<br />
          It's all a long way from the day in 1995 when P.F. Magic created and
          put up for download their own unique and exciting game "Dogz". You
          could download it and try it, and if you liked it you could buy a key
          online -- which also was a new concept back then. It was so popular
          that it was also then released for the Apple Mac in 1996.</b
