    <p>Conversions of my breedz to Petz 5.</p>

    <p>07 september 2003</p>

    <p>
      It has recently come to my attention that there is a problem with breedz
      of mine that someone else has been converting. Specifically, the problem
      is with breedz that have been converted to Petz 5 at Nicky's Petzfriends
      site. Quite a few of my breedz are up there under the "converted"
      sections, and some that look like mine are under the "created" sections.
      It turned out that things were in a bit of chaos with them. ID numbers
      have been changed, furfiles are missing, and in some cases the names have
      been changed. Also there was no acknowledgement of my work on the
      originals, but that is really a minor issue. The main thing is that these
      breedz will have been causing distress to many downloaders because they
      will have crashed the game under certain circumstances.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is too much hate in the world, without allowing it to interfere with
      our gentle hobbies of hexing, breeding and playing with petz! So let's not
      get all screwed up with complaints or accusations; let's just tackle the
      definite problem here, a problem which needed to be sorted out so that
      people could enjoy the breedz.
    </p>

    <p>
      The real problem was <b>not</b> that Nicky had converted my breedz to petz
      5; although I would have liked it if she had checked my site first to see
      if I had Petz 5 versions, I am willing to accept her explanation that she
      did not know that they were mine. I'm still amazed that people were silly
      enough to send her breedz to convert such as my monkeys and ratz, which
      the downloaders <b>must</b> have known I had Petz 5 versions of up at my
      site!! I released all the versions at once for those breedz. It's
      particularly silly of them because the ones here are carefully made so
      that they will speak "monkey" or "rat".
    </p>

    <p>
      (A note here for anyone who's interested -- I prefer to convert my own
      breedz, because I have a lot of complicated things in many of my
      breedfiles, not simply the .lnz sections. If anyone wants a breed of mine
      converted to another version of the game, please contact me in future; if
      it's mine and I've not already converted it, I shall do it.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem was also <b>not</b> that she had renamed some of them; I don't
      like to see my breedz masquerading under different names of course, but
      that's a personal matter.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>real</b> problem was that her conversions all have a different ID
      number from the ones that I gave the originals, also some of them were
      missing essential furfile bitmaps, which means that people who like to
      import pets from earlier versions of the game and breed them will see the
      game crashing just as a "happy event" is about to be announced. So, this
      means that the existence of two different conversions of any given
      breedfile causes difficulties in the Petz Community, and I keep getting
      emails from people who want to know how to fix their pets.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aaaaargh!! That kind of interruption I do not need; my computer-time is
      already too limited these days.
    </p>

    <p>
      So a solution has been found that will keep breeders happy and my mailbox
      less overflowing :-)
    </p>

    <p>
      Nicky still has the files up at her site, except for a couple which really
      <b>had</b> to be removed, so that people who swap pets which were
      originally adopted from her files are not left unable to breed them. She
      has a link to my site under any of the breedz which are obviously mine, so
      that people who have adopted a pet from one of my older versions of the
      game or have downloaded one from the Internet can find a
      <b>proper</b> conversion that will work at my site. Finally, she has a
      warning "agreement" at her site about possible difficulties using her
      conversions of other people's breedz.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that if you want my various species or fantasy pets (particularly for
      instance the Horse) to have the correct sounds, you should really download
      my proper conversions of my breedz. You can download the sounds for my
      breedz at this site, "Carolyn's Creations", of course.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note also that you will not be able to breed a pet from one of the
      conversions from Nicky's site with one adopted from an original same-name
      breedfile at my site unless you do a clever trick to fool Windows. For
      instance, take the Monkey. If you want to have a pet adopted from the
      version downloaded from Nicky's site in your game and you want to breed it
      with one adopted from my proper one, rename the breedfile from her site to
      this:
    </p>

    <p>Monkey.catNicky</p>

    <p>
      (You can rename it by right-clicking on it in My Computer or Windows
      Explorer and choosing "Rename". No need to open it in a hex editor or
      anything -- just rename the file.)<br />
      Then you can run my Monkey.cat in the game as well as Monkey.catNicky. The
      pets will both come out with no problems, and will breed -- at least, they
      do on my Windows 95 system; if they don't on any different operating
      system you have, then I cannot help you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, about the cat breedz which look like mine under Nicky's "created"
      section. I am happy to accept her explanation regarding the Angora cat.
      The Himalayan -- people, forget it. There are a lot of Himalayans on the
      Internet; I agree that one of the ones at Nicky's site looks very like
      mine, but mine is based on a Siamese and the ones at her site are not.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hope this sorts things out and that we can all co-exist in peace,
      helping each other out where necessary and having a good time.
    </p>

    <p>Enjoy!</p>
