    These pages will show any breedz which were the idea and production of
    another hexer, but which turned out to be something of a team effort with
    myself. They go up here with the permission of the other team member(s), of
    course!</p>

    <p>NOTE: If one of the breedz crashes your game,<br>
    <a href="/crashingxp/">please read this.</a></p>

    <p><a href="/sounds/sounds/">Go here for Species sounds</a> and <a href="/sounds/soundsorig/">here for original Catz and Dogz
        sounds</a><br>
    Various Species or Fantasy breedz should have their special sounds; also,
    all the catz and dogz breedz on this site use external sounds. So if you
    want them to sound right in your game, you will have to download the sounds
    as well.</p>
