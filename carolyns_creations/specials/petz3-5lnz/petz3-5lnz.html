    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

    <p><b>LNZ breedfiles are simply overwriting breedfiles which go in a
    ptzfilesdogxx or ptzfilescatxx directory instead of a resourcedogz or
    resourcecatz directory. Once you have my "For Easy LNZ" packages for the
    relevant original breedz installed, your downloaded LNZ hexie will work just
    like any DOG or CAT hexie. Breeders will find that breedz stored in the form
    of .LNZ files are as easy to manage and keep track of as any overwriting
    .DOG or .CAT breed, and have the advantage of being a lot smaller. These LNZ
    files will work with those packages in any of Petz 3, Petz 4 or Petz
    5.</b><br>
    For details of where the files go in your game, <a
        href="/tutorials/LNZBreedHowto/">click here</a><br>
    Hexers, feel free to use the .lnz files if you wish for your own breedz, but
    I would appreciate an acknowledgement of my work.</p>

    <p class="big">For the People breed, go to the <a
        href="/petz/PeopleLNZBreedz/">People LNZ breed</a> page<br>
    For my older LNZ breedz, <a href="/specials/petz3-5lnzp2/">go here</a></p>

    <p><span class="big">Another special request, rather late in appearing --
    thanks for your patience, hypershad0w!</span><br>

    Here are <a href="Kirbycatlnz.zip">the .LNZ files</a>, for use with my
    external-lnz Calico packages which you can get from the "For Easy LNZ"
    pages; it will of course overwrite the normal Calico's .LNZ.<br>
    Go <a href="http://paccybertown.250free.com/Kirby/KirbysPage.html"
        class="defunct"></a> to <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090225143942/http://www.petactorzcattery.com/Downloads/Kirby/Kirby.html">Miranda's
        Kirby page</a> to download some fantastic variations for Catz 3, 4 and
    5!<br>
    Note that Kirby, like Chao, tends to kick the food away. No problem, both he
    and Chao can eat treats and drink from the bottles, so feed them that
    way.</p>

    <img src="Reinwolf.gif" alt="Rein Wolf lnz"><br>
    Here are <a href="Reinwolflnz.zip">the .LNZ files</a>, for use with my
    external-lnz Great Dane packages which you can get from the "For Easy LNZ"
    pages; it will of course overwrite the normal Great Dane's .LNZ.</p>
