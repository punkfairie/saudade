          >My "People" breedfile for the Catz games 3, 4 and 5 in LNZ form</a
        ><br />
        Both PG-rated and naughty versions. If you download and use the naughty
        version, I shall not be held responsible if your computer or parents
        blow a fuse or i fyou end up dancing naked in the snow. Catz II version
        to follow eventually. Note that this is designed to work with My "For
        LNZ-files 'n' easy-edits" Calico cat packages. I did think of making
        them Alleys, but what the heck -- I started with the Calico and was too
        lazy to change :-)<br />

        Vickie of the Petz Zoo has made some babyz for the Dogz games, for which
        I provided the sounds (available on my species sounds page too of
        course); pop along to her site for the breed!
