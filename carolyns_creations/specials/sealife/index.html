    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

    <p>For water-lovers out there, I thought it would be a good idea to make it
    easy for you to find all the aquatic items that are on this site, so here
    they are with a separate section of their own :-)</p>

    <span class="normal">This pool shows up in the Nursery shelves. I use it in
    my <a href="/babyz/babyzplayscene/">"Secret Wood"</a><br>
    It works like the bath, but does not overwrite it. The babyz need not get
    clothed inbubbles -- either remove the bubble clothes from your game's
    clothes directory, or download my <a href="/babyz/babyzclothes/">exotic
        "bikini-bottom"</a> replacements :-)</span></p>

        The KidPool
    </a>
    This pool shows up in the Playroom and Attic closets.<br>
    It works like the Bath, but does not overwrite it and the babyz need not get
    clothed in bubbles.</p>
