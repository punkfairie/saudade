        Reveals the secrets of the LNZ files<br>
        ahahahaaaa!  Hah!  Ahaha...</b><br>
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br></span></p>

    <p class="big">What I'm going to try and do here is to explain to you
      all in more depth what all those mysterious parts of a .LNZ file are
      for, what they do, and how to change them. Once you understand it, you
      will be able to make a breedfile that's almost any shape and have it
      breed reasonably true, or a Babyz of any shape, or a weird and wonderful
      Oddballz breed...</p>

    <p class="big">Trust me. I'm a hexer (bwahahaha...)</p>

    <p class="big">The .LNZ file, or "Linez" file, is the core data that the
      game reads when it is making a pet from a breedfile or a baby from the
      main Resource dll file. You will also find .LNZ sections used for the
      simpler mice or grubz, also in or for a few toyz, such as the
      Auto-rolling Ball or milk bottle. These .LNZ files work the same way as
      the ones for Breedz and Babyz, but because they are associated with
      simpler behavours we are more limited in what we can do with them that
      will actually show up in the game.</p>

    <p class="big">Clothing files have a .CLZ section which is very, very
      similar to .LNZ files. ball-covering clothes (shirts etc) make use of
      Paint Ballz, and hats etc make use of Add Ballz. If you want to insert a
      clothing style into a breedz or babyz .LNZ (for instance, to make the
      antlers permanent), be aware that you can't just copy/paste and change
      the ball numbers. You will also need to do a bit of fiddling -- for
      instance, there are fewer columns in the .CLZ add ball sections than
      there are in the .LNZ ones.</p>

    <p class="big">It has come to my notice that many people don't find how
      the .LNZ file works and what the various programmers' comments,
      mnemonics, keywords and Key Texts are, as blindingly obvious as I do; so
      I'm writing more detailed notes here in hopes that it will help.</p>

    <p class="big">As a prologue, here are<br>
      <a href="/tutorials/LNZ_summary/"><b>Some Important Notes and a
        Summary</b></a></p>

    <p class="big">Now for the meat of the innards (cackle snurk) ;-) I'm
      breaking the whole thing down into chunks.<br>

      <a href="/tutorials/LNZ1st/">The first chunk, here,</a><br>
      contains several areas of the .LNZ which are not present in all breedz.
      These seem to confuse people most<br>

      <a href="/tutorials/LNZ2nd/">The second chunk, here,</a><br>
      contains the major areas which are common to all breedz.<br>
      NOTE that Bodyarea numbers matter for some issues (see the [Add Ball]
      section in the 2nd Chunk).<br>
      Here are the Bodyarea numbers for <a
        href="/tutorials/BabyzBodyAreaNumbers/">Babyz</a> and for <a
        href="/tutorials/CatzBodyAreaNumbers/">Catz</a> and for <a
        href="/tutorials/DogzBodyAreaNumbers/">Dogz</a><br>

      <a href="/tutorials/LNZ3rd/">The third chunk, here,</a><br>
      is all about areas which you can insert into your breed even though they
      are not always actually seen inside an original P.F.Magic breedfile.<br>
      April 29, I've fixed up some typos in this third chunk -- sorry if any
      of them confused you before.<br>

      <a href="/tutorials/LNZ4rd/">The fourth chunk, here,</a><br>
      is all about areas which are entirely specific only to Oddballz.</p>

    <p class="big">Okay, away off now and make some fantastic new breedz or
      babyz. Hexing is fun, enjoy it!<br></p>
