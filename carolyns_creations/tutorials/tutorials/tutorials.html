    for some very useful information on the LNZ files which make up the core of
    your new Petz breed, Oddballz breed, or Babyz. Also helps in understanding
    the .CLZ part of a clothing file etc. Really. No, really. Do go and see.
    It might stop you from writing to me to pick my brains; most of my
    brain-pickings are there :-)<br>

    Compiled by Nicholas Sherlock of <a href="http://www.sherlocksoftware.org/"
        target="_blank">Sherlock Software</a> from my LNZ information and other
    info. Makes the sections easier to find, as well as providing a set of great
    colour-charts for all of the games and a good visual aid to x,y,z
    coordinates. The file is in CHM help format. Only up to date as far as Feb
    2005; check out my LNZ breakdown chunks for later info<br>

    PLEASE NOTE that almost all the tutorials and howtos on my pages were written
    before Nicholas created the marvellous LNZPro and Tinker tools. All the info
    in my howtos is still valid for anyone who wants to understand what goes on
    "under the hood", and my "easy" packages are still fun to use, but these two
    new tools make things amazingly easy for us hexers. Give 'em a try, you know
    you want to :-)</span></p>

    <span class="normal">These are pages of information which Ron Tigat had up
    at his Odd Planet site; while that site is down, it seemed a shame for this
    information to be lost. These pages are of interest to people who edit for
    Oddballz and like to know in-depth stuff. Although Oddballz is not a Win32
    game, the information is still useful for those of us who edit for the Win32
    Petz games.<br></span>
