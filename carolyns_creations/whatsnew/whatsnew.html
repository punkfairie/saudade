        whatever is going on.</p>

        <p><b>18 Mar 2010</b><br>
        Wow, I hear you say, it lives! Well, in a way... I still care about this
        site and the old Petz games, but I have no time. This update is a small
        bit of maintenance -- the page for the Petz 5 backup CD now has some
        necessary Catz dlls. You couldn't get catz to load on it before, but
        with these dll files you should be able to. And the links page -- I have
        kept the old pages as an archive but now, when you click on the "links
        and contact" it takes you to a simple page with urls on it that I have
        checked. Plus, I have a new sister site :) Oh yes, and now that Daniel's
        site is down, I've added the original bunny and pig file downloads to
        the "catz in dogz" and "dogz in catz" pages. I'm very sad to see his
        site down again, and am not sure of exactly what is "broken" on this
        site of mine because of it. I will try to find broken links and fix
        them, but if you find such a link please drop me an email. The mail is
        still the hex-help at hornsc clara co uk one.</p>

        <p><b>20 Aug 2009</b><br>
        Wow, nearly a year later, an update! Well actually I've been adding odd
        things here and there for a while now, but not really "Carolyn's
        Creations" so I've not been mentioning them. But people who are having
        trouble searching for everything for the game foolers are getting the
        odd pleasant surprise if they keep their eyes open; I'm hoping that
        people who have lost or damaged irreplaceable CDs will find them helpful
        also.</p>

        <p>I have also uploaded what you would need in order to be able to play
        with Petz Player files, such as Phantarella on my main page, Babyz
        player files such as the ones on my "play online" Babyz page, and
        perhaps most important, to go into the Catz 1 shrine! ;-)</p>

        <p>Last but not least, the very big news; I now have a full mirror of
        this giant of a site! Bookmark <a
            href="http://www.carolyn.minibytepetz.net/" target="_top">this
            link</a>. Huge thanks to Minibyte!!</p>

        <p>
        <b>30 Sep 2008</b><br>
        I know, I know, I hardly ever update these days. I really don't have the
        time, but I still love the old Petz, Babyz and Oddballz games so I've
        not abandoned you :-) No new hexings for you, but for Babyz players I
        have zipped up the <a href="/babyz/vvccr/">ViaVoice files</a> so
        that people who have been having problems with downloading the
        individual files can get them, plus on that page you will see a link to
        help those of you with damaged or lost CDs. Also there are a few links
        to creative and useful sites on my <a href="/smallislovely/"
            target="_main">"small but beautiful" links page</a>. I have put a
        little more information on the <a href="/petz6/">new "petz" games</a> --
        the ones that Ubisoft now calls Catz 2 and Dogz 2. These are in no way
        like the older Petz II game of course, but the info is there for
        completeness. It's a real nuisance that UbiSoft have chosen to call
        their new 3D pet games Catz, Dogz, Catz 2 and Dogz 2.</p>

        <p><b>15 May 2008</b><br>
        Just a really tiny thing -- a new link on my <a href="/smallislovely/"
            target="_main">"small but beautiful" links page</a> :-) I know
        people have written to me before asking for links to be updated; forgive
        me, I have had various things such as computer crashes over the past few
        months and am not now able to find the messages. If you want a link
        changed, please write to me again.</p>

        <p><b>03 May 2008</b><br>
        It's like a bus, isn't it -- you wait for ages and then two come along
        at once ;-) Okay, the site should now be complete, including the FinFin
        and Petz4 demo downloads. As far as I can see, everything is as it was
        before the site's foundations got slipped from under it. Nothing new,
        and still a messy monster of a site, but hey, the "olds" are back.</p>

        <p><b>02 May 2008</b><br>
        <b>Site is back up and running!</b><br>
        Wow. Almost a year since last we spoke. And even now this is not an
        update -- it's just a note that the site has been fixed after a few
        weeks of downtime. I think everything has been fixed apart from Finfin
        and the Petz 4 demo, I hope so anyway. The Petz 4 demo and Finfin
        downloads I hope to fix tomorrow. Please note what I say above, if my
        site goes down again pop along to <a
            href="http://www.stevehornsc.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/carolyn/index.htm"
            target="_top">this page (click) </a> at Blueyonder, where I hope
        to be able to keep you informed of whatever is going on.</p>

        <p><b>30 June 2007</b><br>
        Just a few tweaks to a couple of the foolers, and some links to other
        places of Petz interest, for you today. My computer play time has
        narrowed down to almost zero while I bottlefeed some grey furries...
        First up, <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/poodlepower707/"
            target="blank">The Petz5 Palace</a> has moved so I've changed the
        link on my "Small is Beautiful" page and I've fixed up one or two other
        links on a couple of the links pages. Next, I have a new links page for
        <a href="/petzhexzlinks/" target="_blank">PetzHexz </a>which is there
        with its affiliates to help with Petz and other virtual life games --
        and the Virtual Life forum is back up!<br>
        Next, for <a href="/babyz/babyzedit/" target="main"
            title="Babyz Fixes">Babyz fooler</a> fans I have put up some files
        from the unpacked Babyz demo for those of you who can't get the demo to
        install. Also on the <a href="/babyz/vvccr/">ViaVoice fix</a> page,
        I've tried to make things a little clearer. For people who wanted the
        Petz 3 playscene Petz Vet and had trouble with the patchfile, I've
        uploaded the full scene on the <a href="/petz/petz3/p3playscenz/"
            target="_blank" title="Old Petz 3 Scenes">Old Petz 3 Scenes</a>page
        3. That's the lot for now.</p>

        <p><b>10 June 2007</b><br>
        As always, in a huge rush. I have for you the abandonware game <a
            href="/finfin/" target="_top">Fin Fin</a><br>
        This update is not actually a Petz item nor is it a Carolyn's Creation,
        but it's a game that has been dumped by its craetors and is too cute to
        lose -- and Sue has kindly agreed to host it. I don't provide any help
        with getting it running, but I do give a link on the download page to a
        very helpful site and forum.</p>

        <p><b>Approx. 20 April 2007</b><br>
        Wups, I uploaded some bits and pieces a few days ago and forgot to
        update this What's New. Things in Real Life here are going like crazy,
        so the site tends to get a bit neglected but uploads still do happen now
        and then. Let's see... I put up a "Pointless Info 2" page to show that
        all the games can be made to work in Windows Vista -- an Operating
        System that I won't touch of course, it's even worse than XP, but I
        thought you'd be interested. I've made it easier to use the Petz II demo
        fooler, it has a whole page to itself now. A tweak or two on the
        Tutorials pages, can't remember in detail now exactly what. And some
        items for Babyz players and hexers on the "newest babyz" page. Sorry
        that updates are so random and far apart, but really I do stuff for the
        site as and when I can. I seem to have lost my latest notes on sites
        which I promised to add to my links pages, my deepest apologies to
        anyone who was expecting a link to go up but really my links pages are
        horribly out of date these days.</p>

        <p><b>18 March 2007</b><br>
        It can't be March <b>already</b>?? Well, a lot has happened so far this
        year but very little of it has been petz-related for me. All I have for
        you this time is an updated link and a tweak or two on my tutorials page
        (a bit more info in my "what to do if petz crashes" and "what to do if
        Babyz crashes" howtos) and my Petz 4 demo-fooler page (get to it via my
        Mad Scientist page). The reason for the demo-fooler update is because it
        seems that demo-download sites now check to see what part of the world
        you live in before letting you download the demo, and if your area isn't
        right they won't let the download start. That is plain evil -- what the
        heck has happened to the Internet?? Gah. Oh, and I realised I'd
        accidentally removed the Phantarella player link from my main page when
        I moved to Boardwalkerz, so she's back on the main page again.<br>
        For those interested in my fostercats, Paddlepat didn't make it through.
        Poor baby. His sisters were spayed this week and, thank heaven, it seems
        that they don't have the same latent disease that he had. They are
        lively and healthy. I am now running the <a
            href="http://www.stevehornsc.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/adoptacat/"
            target="_blank">"adopt-a-cat" scheme </a>which helps to bring in
        some much-needed cash for the Cat Register and Rescue, so my time is now
        even more limited. And a wonderful thing happened which I'd like to
        shout to the heavens, but I can't put it on the sites, aaaargh.</p>

        <p><b>09 February 2007</b><br>
        Just to let you know I'm still here, but 2007 is being a bit of a pain
        so not much is updated. I did a tiny update to the <a
            href="/oddballz/oddballz/">Oddballz </a>and oddballz fooler pages a
        couple of weeks ago but am blowed if I can remember what exactly.
        Updated my <a href="/newlinks/">"new links" </a>page. And today I have a
        great new <a href="/sisters/" target="_top">sister site </a>-- Miranda's
        PAC, which will be updated shortly with new breedz etc, so keep an eye
        on it! That's it for now. I've got a very very sick cat at the moment,
        <a
            href="http://www.stevehornsc.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/carolyn/catpics/2006/Paddlepat.htm"
            target="_top" title="Paddlepat">Paddlepat</a>Paddlepat needs all my
        care and attention but he probably won't survive, so please keep the wee
        fellow in your thoughts and prayers.</p>

        <p><b>07 January 2007</b><br>
        Already the year is starting to zoom along... But I have a small update
        for Babyz players -- <a href="/babyz/babyztoyz/">kitchen magnets
            separated.</a> Sorry that's it for now, I have a new cat in who
        needs plenty of attention.</p>

        <p><b>02 January 2007</b><br>
        Woah, another year has started... Happy New Year! Just another small
        update for Petz 4 players <a href="/petz/petz4/p4toyz/">a bunch of
            un-hidden toyz.</a> It doesn't include the ones which don't have
        on-shelf graphics, nor does it include the four gemstones. I may get
        those up soon, if Real Life doesn't take off too fast. And for Petz 3, 4
        and 5 people who like to dabble in editing the binary parts of petz with
        a hex editor, I've put a little more info up on the <a
            href="/tutorials/petbreakdown/">Rough Pet Info</a> page.</p>

        <p><b>31 December 2006</b><br>
        Happy Hogmanay!! I have one small updates for you -- a howto on <a
            href="/tutorials/trottingandfloofing/">Trotting and Floofing .</a>
        wrote the thing ages ago and then forgot to upload it because LNZPro had
        a tick-box for it. But it seems that doesn't really work, so here's how
        to do it manually. Including how to make your chinchilla Persians trot,
        LOL.</p>

        <p><b>28 December 2006</b><br>
        I hope your Yuletide is going well -- that the celebrations continue and
        that the coming weekend will produce a great hogmanay. I have one or two
        very small updates for you -- <a href="/tutorials/yarntailcolour/">a
            howto on</a> changing the Yarn Ball tail colour, <a
            href="/newlinks/">a page of new links</a> and a bit more on <a
            href="/petz6/">Ubisoft's latest "Petz" games including</a> info
        about the Windows Horsez. Finally, for those of you who are interested
        in my fostercats, there's updates <a
            href="http://www.stevehornsc.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/carolyn/cats.htm"
            target="_top">at that site too.</a></p>

        <p>
        <b>22 December 2006</b><br>
        My hearty thanks to Sue for the lovely new splash page that she has made
        for me, and for the terrific new link banner and button, which are now
        of course on my links page -- although I've not managed to update it
        apart from that...<br>

        <br>
        Wishing you all a very happy holiday season and a joyous christmas,
        Hanukkah, New Year, Solstice -- or whatever else you enjoy celebrating
        at this time of year. Me, I like to just sit and listen to the world
        turn on its axis :-) May 2007 be a good year for us all, and a fun year
        for Petz and modding. I now have a wordy little treatise on <a
            href="/hexingmodding/">What IS "hexing?"</a> -- MODDING!</p>

        <p><b>16 December 2006</b><br>
        Nothing new for you at all today, I'm so sorry -- well, apart from the
        <a href="/babyz/vvccr/">Babyz ViaVoice fix</a> which I uploaded a while
        ago and forgot to mention -- I've not even managed to get the links I
        promised to update for various wonderful site-owners all fixed up, I
        promise I'll try to get that done on my next update. All that's
        happening this time is that my site is moving over fully now to the
        mirror that Sue provided for several months. Abby has been wonderful for
        hosting my stuff for so long after she lost interest in Petz, and Sue
        has been a trojan for seamlessly taking over the bandwidth burden. For
        anyone who has been linking directly to various pages at my
        Petzwarehouse site, such as the Babyz colour chart, I'm sorry -- the
        link will have broken. Come along to my site here at <a
            href="/sues_virtual_life/?@root" target="_top">Boardwalkerz </a>for
        all the information and charts that used to be there.</p>

        <p><b>01 December 2006</b><br>
        Still nothing really for you -- but I do have a brief note about the
        latest Virtual life games from Ubisoft <a href="/petz6/">here </a>. They
        really are not a part of the Petz series, but for completeness I mention
        them.</p>

        <p><b>14 November 2006</b><br>
        Another month on, and nothing much for you -- but for Babyz fans I have
        three versions of Stewie and three different "cow bells" for them to
        wear on my <a href="/babyz/babyznewest/" target="main"
            title="Newest Babyz">Newest Babyz</a> page. Real Life and my kitties
        are taking so much of my time, bless the furry ones.</p>

        <p><b>19 October 2006</b><br>
        Sorry it's been so long... and even now there's nothing new really, but
        I've adjusted a few pages to make things a little easier to find -- I
        hope. I've put the "if you can't download you're at the wrong place"
        info even easier to find as well as trying to make things such as the
        Babyz Fooler easier to follow. Also not new, but just to let anyone who
        needs help with Tinker or LNZPro or Petza/Babyza know -- the link to his
        download site is on my Nicholas' Tools page, along with links to useful
        info. My links pages are woefully unkempt now, I'm sorry -- I can't face
        going through it all but I hope to adjust the most obvious and add an
        extra page of fresh, interesting sites soon. I've simply not been
        getting the time to do things properly -- take a look at <a
            href="http://www.stevehornsc.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/carolyn/cats.htm"
            target="_blank" title="my fostercats">my fostercats site</a> for
        some idea of how busy I've been. And a lot has happened even since I
        updated there, LOL!</p>

        <p><b>30 July 2006</b><br>
        Yes, I know, I've not updated for two months -- I can't begin to tell
        you how busy things have been here, so I've not updated either this site
        or my fostercats one in all that time. As for this update, it's just for
        oddballz fans. Because Daniel's site is down and now, it seems, also
        Don's Amberoddballz, plus nowhere else on the net seems to have the
        demos, I've uploaded a demo and the official breedz to this site, also
        Ron Tigat's Oddballz Eggz Scrambler. You will find these things on the
        <a href="/oddballz/oddballzedit/">Oddballz Fixes</a> and <a
            href="/oddballz/oddballzfooler/">Oddballz Fooler</a> pages.<br>
        Also uploaded on the new p2, p3, p4 and p5 pages are the skorch
        breedfiles for Catz games. They are on the relevant New Breedz pages,
        and the sound files are on the species sounds page. These were once
        exclusive to Daniel's site but since I created them and his site is down
        they have come home to me.<br>
        I wanted to do more, but that's it for now. Hopefully not so long before
        the next update. Must dash.</p>

        <p><b>21 May 2006</b><br>
        Sorry, a late update and I've not got much for you -- Real Life has been
        getting in the way big-time and I've only managed to update my <a
            href="http://www.stevehornsc.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/carolyn/cats.htm"
            target="_top">My foster-cat site</a> since I last updated here --
        and even there I'm not up to date. And I'm not managing to do half of
        what I've been promising people on this update, sorry. But there are
        some little things.<br>
        A bunch of experimental babyz, and more of my "Harem set" on the <a
            href="/babyz/babyznewest/" target="main" title="Newest Babyz">Newest
            Babyz</a> page. Yes, I know there aren't any pictures and that
        should have the harem clothes on the clothes page. I don't have time to
        do it right!<br>
        On the <a href="/collaborations/" target="main"
            title="Collaborations">Team creations</a> page you'll find a new
        Catz breed made from Casey Miller's pet. Also there, my few Unibreedz --
        Artie, Honkie and Sauropod -- should be fixed for cross-breeding as they
        were re-done with the latest LNZPro.<br>
        I've put the catz 1 demo up for download on my <a
            href="/petz/petz1/catz1dex/">Catz 1 demo fooler</a> page.<br>
        If you go to my sister site, <a href="http://boardwalkerz.com/babyz"
            target="_top">Sue Briley's Babyz Punked</a>, you'll find there a
        couple of unusual babyz and a babyz clothing item, for Naturists, made
        by myself.<br>
        I've got a couple of great cyberpets from Dulua Land up on my Cyberpets
        page.<br>
        NOT YET done -- a whole bunch of howtos, which will eventually go on a
        "pot-luck" page, more half-done hexed stuff, and fixing up my links
        pages. I don't know when these will get done, but one thing I will try
        to get fixed and up soon is Miranda's brilliant sounds for Kirby.</p>

        <p><b>03 March 2006</b><br>
        As always later than intended, but I added what I believe to be the
        final soundfixes to the <a href="/babyz/babyzxpsoundfix/">Babyz soundfix
            for XP</a> page. The new downloads and replacements are marked with
        the date beside them, so if you downloaded most of the files before
        today, just download those which are marked. My friend gave the whole
        thing a quick test, and with any luck this will prevent any
        sound-related freezes in your game now. Remember, people, you do need to
        also download 9 toyz from Twilight's site -- the link is clearly on my
        soundfix page. And yay for Sandi of <a
            href="http://www.geocities.com/songshirah3/index2.html"
            target="_top">Forever Babyz</a> -- she gave an award to myself and
        Twilight, and I'm displaying it with pride :-) Thank you so much!<br>

        Well, I fell over today and twisted and bruised me poor arthritic old
        bones, so not as much done as I'd hoped. But I have a couple of great
        breedz for you on the Team Creations, <a
            href="/withsueandnintendo/" target="_blank">"With Sue Briley and
            Nintendo-6444"</a> page,<br>
        <img src="2006-02-27.gif"><br>
        and yesterday and today I added to the <a
            href="/babyz/babyzxpsoundfix/">Babyz soundfix for XP</a> -- have not
        been able to test the latest fixes myself yet but have had good reports
        so far. I am intending to fine-tune the soundfix over the next day or
        two.</p>

        <p><b>25 February 2006</b><br>
        I know, I know, I've not done anything much this month so far. Real Life
        has been taking almost all my time. All I have for you today is a <a
            href="/babyz/babyzxpsoundfix/">Babyz soundfix for XP</a>, but with
        any luck that'll at least make many of the Babyz Commumity happy.</p>

        <p><b>07 February 2006</b><br>
        Once again, I've not managed to update as I wanted to. I've been having
        some Real Life difficulties, so updates are of necessity going to be
        slow for the near future -- but they will happen, truly. But for now,
        great news! Not only do we have <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">a new
            version of Tinker</a>, but also Nicholas has <a
            href="http://www.sherlocksoftware.org" target="_blank"
            title="Nicholas' own site!">his own site.</a> The latest versions of
        his software will always be found there :-) Also there are some updates
        on the links pages.</p>

        <p><b>28 January 2006</b><br>
        Yes, I know -- I've not updated in ages. There have been all sorts of
        Real Life crises, all getting resolved okay but taking time, so all my
        wonderful hexing plans have had to wait. The Great Present Caper is of
        course finished, but I'm making my donations for Petz games available
        for you all. You can download them when you find the picture of a
        present. Also downloadable now, from my babyz toyz pages, is the
        Christmas Spoon that I made for DRN's Advent Calendar. I've fixed up
        some items on my links pages, and got a new "Sister". And finally, some
        weird and wacky babyz for your downloading pleasure on the <a
            href="/babyz/babyzheadbanger/">pasted-heads page</a>.<br>
        <img src="2006-01-28.gif"><br>
        Coming soon (I hope) will be some "Team Creation" breedz, for some of
        which I just need to get the pages done.</p>

        <p><b>02 January 2006</b><br>
        Nicholas has updated <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Petza to fix</a>
        the Petz II and Babyz bugs. It works beautifully now -- go get it!!
        That's it for today, but pretty good all the same :-)</p>

        <p><b>01 January 2006</b><br>
        <b>Happy New Year!!</b><br>
        So I didn't get the hexing time I'd hoped for this past week... But we
        have from the wonderful Nicholas -- another new version of Petza from
        his <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools</a> pages. This
        update, version 2.0.2, fixes some problems for Petz 3, 4 and 5 players.
        On my machine it crashes in Babyz and Petz II, so I've left 2.0.1 up for
        you as well just in case the same happens with you. I've also got some
        changes on my links pages, a new sister, and a changed link to Miranda's
        Kirby page on my P3,4,5 LNZ breedz page.</p>

        <p><b>26 December 2005</b><br>
        The Great Present Caper is apparently delayed until tomorrow. Should be
        good anyway! And now, from Nicholas -- a new version of Petza from his
        <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools</a> pages. This
        update, version 2.0.1, fixes the "weather" bug for Petz 5 players!</p>

        <p><b>24 December 2005</b><br>
        The Great Present Caper should be under way -- good hunting! The big
        Christmas present for you at this site today is from Nicholas -- a new
        version of Petza from his <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas'
            Tools</a> pages. There's some good stuff in it, including a great
        new feature for Babyz players; you can at last add new playscenes!
        Remember that you will need to make them non-overwriting with their own
        name and ID numbers of course. Apart from that, my <a
            href="/cyberpets/cyberpets/">Cyberpet</a> has grown up at last,
        there are a couple of updated <a href="/links/">links</a>, and I've had
        a nice time with my <a href="/flowers/">"gifts from friends" pages</a>.
        Yes, I meant to get a lot of hexed items up, but in the end I only
        managed to complete some presents for the Great Present Caper. Am hoping
        for some peaceful days over this coming week to finish off other
        goodies. Merry Yueltide!</p>

        <p><b>07 December 2005</b><br>
        Just the Great Present Caper notice above, and a couple of updated
        links; Miranda's PAC on <a href="/links/">the main links page</a> , and

        The last of the demo-foolers is now online, thanks to Daniel! This time
        it's the turn of Mac players of the games. Get the <a
            href="/petz/petz1/catz1dex/">Catz 1 demo fooler</a> , and the <a
            href="/petz/petz1/dogz1fooler/">Dogz 1 demo fooler</a> -- and last
        but not
        least, the <a href="/oddballz/oddballzfooler/">Oddballz demo fooler</a>!
        Now <b>everyone</b> can join the fun :-)</p>

        <p><b>03 December 2005</b><br>
        Another one of my toyz converted on my <a href="/petz/petz5/p5toyz/">petz
            5</a> page -- the freedom fish to overwrite your fish bowl. I'll be
        converting the playscene for it soon, but that's not done yet. The big
        thing for you today is the <a href="/petz/petz1/catz1dex/">Catz 1 demo
            fooler</a> (yay!) and <a href="/petz/petz1/dogz1fooler/">my own Dogz
            1
            demo fooler</a>, which allows you to go back to the adoption centre
        and take Daphne's quiz. I have captured the flavour of the Catz 1 site
        as it was when the game first came out, complete with some little
        surprises, a find-it and the part which I personally adored -- the <a
            href="/petz/dream/">VRML temple.</a> I totally loved that thing, and
        I can still play it on my old browser. You may not be able to see it,
        which would be a shame, but I do have links to viewers on that page. If
        you can install the Cosmo player, that would be optimum. If you do
        manage to play it, the links within it have been updated to links that
        actually work. Also, all actual links on the pages should lead to
        interesting things. Anyway, have fun!</p>

        <p><b>28 November 2005</b><br>
        Managing to get some stuff done at last. Some conversions... The Secret

        for
        dracoz (I intend to improve the P3 and P4 ones some day too). An
        exciting new toy for <a href="/petz/petz2/p2toyz/">petz II</a> -- fishes
        swimming in and out of a tank, yay! I intend to make a Petz 3 version of
        that soon. Also for Petz II, the <a href="/petz/petzfish/">Fishie

        <a href="/babyz/babyztoyz/">"surprise box" for Babyz</a>, mostly as a
        service for hexers who requested it. Plus again a few updated tweaks
        over the past couple of weeks, on tutorials and links pages, which I
        can't remember in detail, sorry, but do check out the "small is

        the babyz tutorials page, specifically from <a
            href="/tutorials/hexerbaby/">its own</a> page. I added a bit of a
        tidy-up to the baby file to make it a little clearer, and tried to
        explain how it's used and the potential that it has :-) Finally, a bit
        of info for people who might have been pulling out hair trying to make
        hexed Petz playscenes show up -- on the <a

        A new version of Tinker on the (heh) <a
            href="/specials/nicholastools/">Tinker</a> page. On the Real Life
        front, I've recently updated my <a
            href="http://www.stevehornsc.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/carolyn/cats.htm">fostercats
            site</a> too. Must dash, chores to do... Happy daze...</p>

        <p><b>26 September 2005</b><br>
        Over the past week or so, a few odd bits and pieces got uploaded here
        and there mostly on my <a href="/tutorials/tutorials/">Tutorials</a>
        pages. Firs off, a grand Variations tutorial by Nicholas, which is on my
        main tutorials page and on his <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Pet
            Workshop</a> page. Also on that main page are a new "What to do if
        Petz won't start or crashes" FAQ and a similar one for Babyz, plus I've
        updated my LNZPro tips. On the Petz-specific page I've put a howto on
        making non-hidden emoticon variations in a breed, how to change and
        expand tails for dogz and catz, giving your petz' eyes or "irises" a
        texture (includes example petz), and putting bunny ears on a Dane. The
        perspicacious amongst you will have spotted that I've got a new page
        called <a href="/tutorials/petbreakdown/">Rough Pet Info</a> which is
        exactly what it says. It breaks a pet file into sections so that you can
        see the structure, and see where the important parts are when it comes
        to cloning a corrupted pet. It really is rough -- a series of
        screengrabs -- so if you don't understand anything about pet files it
        won't help. But it's a handy reference that I made for myself ages ago
        and I'm sharing with you now. I'm also sharing with you a set of lists
        of Bodyarea numbers that I intended to put in with some "howtos" but as
        I've not managed to get those written, you'll find the lists on my <a
            href="/tutorials/LNZdetails/">Vital LNZ info</a> main page. I added
        some info into the relevant LNZ chunk also. Slight improvement to my <a
            href="/petz/petz5/p5foolersucess/">Petz 5 demo-fooler </a>. Errr...
        I
        think that's the lot, it's been a weird couple of weeks and difficult to
        do more than snatch a moment or two at the computer now and then.</p>

        <p><b>15 September 2005</b><br>
        Just a real quickie -- a new brilliant version of LNZPro on <a
            href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools</a> pages! Edit
        .baby files, and make Unibreed versions of your breedz that should work
        on Non-English petz 3 games as well!</p>

        <p><b>11 September 2005</b><br>
        New bug-fix version of Pet Workshop -- and a great new beta-test version
        of LNZPro on <a href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools</a>
        pages! Note that the LNZPro has not been tested thoroughly, but I think
        you'll like the newest feature. New links on my<a href="/links/">main
            links</a> page, a couple of them in the tutorials etc section to
        help people who ask about website making, and one of them is also in the
        section called "Sites for "realistic" petz standards, and petz clubs"
        because it's a promising new breed registry site which also offers
        hosting of breedz. The week went by too fast, still none of the other
        things that I meant to do are finished, sorry. But my <a
            href="http://www.stevehornsc.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/carolyn/cats.htm"

        A new version of Petza/babyza on <a
            href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools</a> pages. This has
        no new features, it's another version he's made to try and help track
        down the problem that some people have with it, so if it's working for
        you there's no need to download. Also one link removed from my
        <a href="/smallislovely/">"small is beautiful" </a>page; after I had
        given them info on how to make files available for download, Sarah and
        Ruby proceeded to "hotlink" to other sites' breedz. folks, this is a
        huge no-no on the Internet; don't do it! They appear to no longer be
        answering emails, so until they do and fix the problem, their link will
        stay down.</p>

        Whew, that was a tough few days -- it looked as if Petzwarehouse was
        down for good, and I was worried about Abby. But last night I heard from
        Abby, she's fine :-D and the site should be up today *happy-dance*<br>
        Meanwhile, my good pal Sue picked up my broken pieces and generously

        Yup, another version of Petza/Babyza, version 1.1.4; also another
        version of Pet Workshop, also version 1.1.4. As always, they are on <a
            href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools pages</a>. I've got
        a small howto on the tutorials, <a
            href="/petz/petzedit/#BRE">Petz-specific page</a> because I've been
        asked a few times how to change the default pet name at the AC. I have a
        bunch of other howtos waiting to be polished up and uploaded, they're
        too rough at the moment. Some nice shiny new links on the <a

            href="http://www.stevehornsc.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/carolyn/cats.htm"
            target="_BLANK">there also</a> but be warned, the latest update was
        quite sad.</p>

        Another version of Petza/Babyza, this time a "bugfix" version 1.4.3
        thanks to people who sent Nicholas their bug reports, and to Nicholas
        too of course :-) as usual on <a
            href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools page</a>; thanks yet
        again, Nicholas! Also another neat link on my <a
            href="/smallislovely/">"small is beautiful" </a>links page.</p>

        Nearly 3 weeks since I last uploaded... So sorry! Well, today I've
        uploaded Pet Workshop version 1.1.3 on <a
            href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools page</a>; thanks,
        Nicholas! Various improvements for the program's fans, so go see! One or
        two little tweaks here and there on the site too, including adjustments
        to the Petz 4, Babyz and Petz 5 foolers. Also some updated links on my
        links pages, and for those who follow my fostercats I've recently
        updated <a
            href="http://www.stevehornsc.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/carolyn/cats.htm"
            target="_BLANK">there also.</a> Oh, and I don't think I mentioned
        earlier that I am hosting <a
            href="http://www.geocities.com/cheesycrustie/"
            target="_BLANK">Iola</a>'s Miniature Bows for Dogz on my <a
            href="/offsitespecials/" target="_blank">Off-site specials</a>, as
        she has had some server problems and in fact had lost all of them. Well,
        they are all back online again now :-)</p>

        We had Live 8 up here in Edinburgh today -- nearly a quarter of a
        million people marching to Make Poverty History -- yay!<br>
        But, back to Petz -- we have version 1.4.2 of Petza.toy (which is also
        Babyza of course) for you on <a
            href="/specials/nicholastools/">Nicholas' Tools page</a>. A minor
        update, but hopefully a useful one. Also, Kirby fans check out the link
        on my <a href="/specials/petz3-5lnz/">P3,4,5 LNZ breedz page</a> --
        <a href="http://paccybertown.250free.com/Kirby/KirbysPage.html">Miranda</a>
        has made some great variations! I meant to get some other things
        uploaded, but the day has been chaos -- well, the whole week has really.
        Hope to do more soon.</p>
