            Hello! Welcome to Saudade. This is an archive for petz, babyz, and oddballz sites. The Petz community has
            been around a long time, and many sites that were once pillars of the community have been lost.
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091002091450/http://www.minibytepetz.net/Minibyte_Petz/home.html"
               target="_blank">Minibyte's archive</a>
            once did the job that I am attempting to do now, someday I hope to amass her collection!
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>On each page, there is a menu in the top right corner. It looks like this:</p>

        <div id="heart">♥</div>

        <p>
            Hover over it to open the menu! The menu will have a link back to this page, the changelog for that
            particular site, and the Wayback capture link if applicable.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <!--------------------------------------------- methodology --------------------------------------------------->

        <h3>methodology:</h3>

        <p>
            For each site, I re-create each page by hand. Yes! This is tedious, especially for large sites. There are a
            couple of reasons I do this rather than download the site as-is:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Most sites are rather disorganized, so I shuffle things around to make a bit more sense and to preserve
                what's left of my sanity.
            </li>
            <li>
                It makes it easier to check broken links and update them, find the Wayback version, or mark them as
                broken.
            </li>
            <li>
                I would need to go through each page and inject the little menu that links back here & to the changelog
                anyway.
            </li>
            <li>
                The biggest reason: most of these sites were made 15-20+ years ago, when the internet, HTML, and CSS
                were in their infancies. Much of the code is wildly outdated and at risk of being deprecated. I update
                the code as much as possible while preserving the style of the site, as a way of "future-proofing". I
                want this archive to last as long as possible!
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Sites are not posted here until either the whole site goes down, or noticable chunks start to break.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each site has a changelog that can be found by clicking the little floating menu in the top right corner!
        </p>

        <p>
            Hello! I'm marley, or mar @ epiphany on forums/Discord, or punkfairie various other places. I own Epiphany,
            which can be found
            <a href="https://fantazzled.com/epiphany/" target="_blank">here</a>.
            I've been in the PC on and off for 15+ years, since about the 4th grade or so. This community is the reason
            I know how to code! It's a place that's near and dear to my heart.
        </p>

            when it was up, and a few years ago when it went down I got to thinking I'd like to make something like
            that. I did start it, but lost interest in Petz and ended up deleting all the files when cleaning my hard
            drive.
        </p>

        <p>
            In Feb of 2022 I was bored and wanted a coding project, and remembered that idea I'd had for a Petz archive.
            A few weeks later, I bought punkfairie.net and uploaded the archive of Petz 5 World! That was the first Petz
            site I ever remember visiting as a child, and it seemed fitting to make that my first entry to my archive.
        </p>

        <p>
            I hope you enjoy your time here, whether you're reminiscing on old friendships or curious what the PC of
            yesteryear got up to. ♥
