Renamed page files to something more semantic, rather than id#

Removed the "undefined" boxes at the top, because I'm pretty sure those are just angelfire ad inserts and not part of
the actual site design

Got rid of frames and put everything in one file for each page (using css to recreate the frames effect) because none of
the menus were shared between pages, and I didn't want 3 files for every single page
