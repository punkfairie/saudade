    <h2>Fantasyz (Catz)</h2>

    <p>
        All my breedz are proudly made from the original PFM breedz! "From scratch." ;-) Sounds I use are either in
        game, compiled by me, or from Carolyn, whose brilliance is a great inspiration, and her patience is astounding.
    </p>

    <p>
        Do not directly link to my files, and if you distribute them, please give me credit. Breedz are listed
        alphabetically.
    </p>

    <p>
        .cat files need to go in Resource\Catz folder. The files are zipped, so you need an unzipping program such as
        <u>WinZip </u>to use them. You do not need any other breedz files or anything to use these. Sound files are
        available when possible. If sounds aren't available, they may be eventually, but the breed is currently silent
        (not cat/dog sounds).
    </p>

    <p>
        Breedz won't show up in the AC? The most common problem is that the Bunny.cat breed file was changed or deleted.
        (If you also have Dogz, you need the Pig.dog file too.) If you don't have these breedz in your game, the last
        ones in the Adoption Center won't show up. (Breedz are listed alphabetically, so the "VPZ" breedz tend to be the
        ones that drop off.) You need to either reinstall your game or download the Bunny (and/or Pig) from <a
        href="http://www.dmwright.com/petz/" target="_blank" title="http://www.dmwright.com/petz/"
        class="defunct">http://www.dmwright.com/petz/</a></p>

    <p>
        <b class="big">***If only one file is available, it is a "unibreed" file that will work in Petz 3, 4, and 5!</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>If you have trouble downloading, right-click the link and choose "Save Target As..." All the files should
            work. (Although I can't verify Petz 3 or 4 downloads, since I don't use those games.) Sometimes files are
            interrupted in download, and you get corrupted messages, especially for large files and especially if you
            use dial-up. TRY AGAIN LATER.</i>

                    Believed to have evolved in parallel to the Achihond, the Achichat too has just recently been
                    spotted wandering into regions away from their polar homeland. People called them "angel cats" and
                    believed them to be celestial creatures, especially when they actually come in to contact with man
                    and react with neither fear nor agression (due to their homelands so far from the influence of man).
                    Long ago, they might have been solitary like most other small cat species, but these catz have
                    developed unique hunting styles that reduce intraspecific competition. The cats that have taken
                    flight opt to hunt small birds, much the way raptors do. Some developed coarse fur and are adept
                    swimmers, catching fish and other aquatic prey. The remainder prey mostly upon small mammals. Little
                    is known about the interactions between these and thei canine counterparts. One theory is that the
                    species have never met, with the dogz living at the south pole and the catz' domain in the north.
                    (This breed is entirely of my invention.)

                    Cabbits are meowing, hopping, carrot-loving creatures who, in their lapine-feline form, are playful
                    and harmless. At his owner's command, the cabbit can transform into a powerful starship. The most
                    famous cabbit is Ryo-ohki, companion of the infamous space pirate Ryoko. (This breed was inspired by
                    the series Tenchi Muyo.)

                    In a fantasy world of medieval Japan, occasionally a cat will develop an extra tail. These felines,
                    sometimes called "two-tails," tend to possess magical abilities. The best known two-tail's name is
                    Kirara (or Kilala depending on translation), companion of the demon-slayer Sango. Kirara has the
                    ability to transform into a large, powerful, flying cat at whim and serves as mount and loyal
                    fighting companion for Sango and her human, half-human, and "other" friends. (This breed was
                    inspired by the series <i>Inu Yasha</i>.)

                    What skinless soulless beast is this, untimely roused from its eternal slumber? Perhaps these
                    creatures met unpleasant fates in life. Perhaps they have returned for some holy or unholy purpose.
                    Maybe they are merely the results of a bored hexer with an overactive imagination... Whatever they

                    offset as the other versions. Petz adopted in Petz 3 or 4 will need this file to import.
