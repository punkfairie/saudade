    <h2>Fantasyz (Catz)</h2>

    <p>
    All my breedz are proudly made from the original PFM breedz! "From scratch." ;-) Sounds I use are either in
    game, compiled by me, or from Carolyn, whose brilliance is a great inspiration, and her patience is astounding.
    </p>

    <p>
    Do not directly link to my files, and if you distribute them, please give me credit. Breedz are listed
    alphabetically.
    </p>

    <p>
    .cat files need to go in Resource\Catz folder. The files are zipped, so you need an unzipping program such as
    <u>WinZip </u>to use them. You do not need any other breedz files or anything to use these. Sound files are
    available when possible. If sounds aren't available, they may be eventually, but the breed is currently silent
    (not cat/dog sounds).
    </p>

    <p>
    Breedz won't show up in the AC? The most common problem is that the Bunny.cat breed file was changed or deleted.
    (If you also have Dogz, you need the Pig.dog file too.) If you don't have these breedz in your game, the last
    ones in the Adoption Center won't show up. (Breedz are listed alphabetically, so the "VPZ" breedz tend to be the
    ones that drop off.) You need to either reinstall your game or download the Bunny (and/or Pig) from <a
        href="http://www.dmwright.com/petz/" target="_blank" title="http://www.dmwright.com/petz/"
        class="defunct">http://www.dmwright.com/petz/</a></p>

    <p>
    <b class="big">***If only one file is available, it is a "unibreed" file that will work in Petz 3, 4, and 5!</b>
    </p>

    <p>
    <i>If you have trouble downloading, right-click the link and choose "Save Target As..." All the files should
    work. (Although I can't verify Petz 3 or 4 downloads, since I don't use those games.) Sometimes files are
    interrupted in download, and you get corrupted messages, especially for large files and especially if you
    use dial-up. TRY AGAIN LATER.</i>

                Believed to have evolved in parallel to the Achihond, the Achichat too has just recently been
                spotted wandering into regions away from their polar homeland. People called them "angel cats" and
                believed them to be celestial creatures, especially when they actually come in to contact with man
                and react with neither fear nor agression (due to their homelands so far from the influence of man).
                Long ago, they might have been solitary like most other small cat species, but these catz have
                developed unique hunting styles that reduce intraspecific competition. The cats that have taken
                flight opt to hunt small birds, much the way raptors do. Some developed coarse fur and are adept
                swimmers, catching fish and other aquatic prey. The remainder prey mostly upon small mammals. Little
                is known about the interactions between these and thei canine counterparts. One theory is that the
                species have never met, with the dogz living at the south pole and the catz' domain in the north.
                (This breed is entirely of my invention.)

                and harmless. At his owner's command, the cabbit can transform into a powerful starship. The most
                famous cabbit is Ryo-ohki, companion of the infamous space pirate Ryoko. (This breed was inspired by
                the series Tenchi Muyo.)

                In a fantasy world of medieval Japan, occasionally a cat will develop an extra tail. These felines,
                sometimes called "two-tails," tend to possess magical abilities. The best known two-tail's name is
                Kirara (or Kilala depending on translation), companion of the demon-slayer Sango. Kirara has the
                ability to transform into a large, powerful, flying cat at whim and serves as mount and loyal
                fighting companion for Sango and her human, half-human, and "other" friends. (This breed was
                inspired by the series <i>Inu Yasha</i>.)

                What skinless soulless beast is this, untimely roused from its eternal slumber? Perhaps these
                creatures met unpleasant fates in life. Perhaps they have returned for some holy or unholy purpose.
                Maybe they are merely the results of a bored hexer with an overactive imagination... Whatever they
                are, hopefully you can provide a nice home.

                Moggie is the word given to mixed breed cats (just like "mutt" for dogz). Many people have known a
                moggie or two or many, as these cats overpopulate pounds and shelters and are found as stray kittens. A
                typical moggie always has its own unique look and personality, but is usually not extreme in type (like
                persians and siamese) unless these breeds are not too far back in the family tree. In this file,
                literally trillions of possibilities exist, as in real life, including polydactyls (extra-toed catz) and
                blind catz. (You can see some examples of these variations <a href="moggiez/" target="_top"

                Long-eared squirrel creatures that exist in the realms of Hayao Miyazaki films. These animals are from
                times past. In one movie they exist on a mystical floating island where they frolic care-free. In
                another they are scarce, their existence threatened by the expansion of the toxic forest. One of these
                creatures befriends an amazing girl named Nausicaa and is her constant companion. (Based on the "fox

                asked my roommate, she told me about the "shadow cat" she sees. Sure enough, I checked my cages, and all
                were accounted for. The shadow is now a frequent phenomenon, it hugs the walls most of the time and

                <img src="441b0390.gif"><br>
                11,000 years ago, while the great glaciers melted and receded to the poles, humans migrated through
                Asia, into North America and to South America. This was the time of mass extinction of megafauna (giant
                animals, as large or larger than elephants, mostly grazing mammals and their predators). In the midst of
                this climate change and hunting, very few of these enormous species survived. Some were simply hunted to
                extinction, others were too specialized for cold climates (before this time, tundra covered large
                areas), and their habitats were lost.<br>
                <br>
                (Real history above. ;-) Fantasy part follows.)<br>
                <br>
                On a few small islands near Greenland, one such animal, a relict species, still exists. Seen by a few
                lucky researchers, the animal has been named the snokat. It stands up to 2 meters at the shoulders and
                weighs up to 5 tons. The snowkat resembles something between an enourmous lion or polar bear. It is
                known to roar and exhibits feline behavior. It is believed tat the snokat feeds mainly on seals. During
                anchient times, the snokat's range probably included much of the North American continent, and probably
                fed on the large, now extinct, grazing animals including mammoths and prehistoric buffalo species. The
                snokat hibernates for a large part of the year and can be seen for a brief time in spring, hunting in a
                pride for as much food as possible before mating and returning to hibernation.<br>
                <br>
                The snokat is primarily white with mostly cool icy tones to its skin. When it lived in less harsh
                conditions, the species was probably a darker color, and occasionally a beige colored cub shows up.
                (These do not often survive in the tundra and are sometimes even abandoned by their mothers.) Snokats
                seem to vary some in shape and color, evidence to a thriving gene pool despite their reduced range. Some
                snokats have long tusks, once used to pierce thick mastadon hide but now neither a help nor hiderance.
                Short or no tails have evolved to conserve heat, though long-tailed snokats occur in some places, and
                they curl their tails around themselves for warmth. The long tail is likely a remnant from earlier
                times.<br>
                <br>
                (The snokat is my own creation but inspired by the real Wisconsin Maximum glaciation and mass extinction
                of megafauna.)<br>

                The SWoT is a small forest-dwelling mammal. It is a unique case of parallel adaptation, being legless

                earthworms, aspecially when young, but will take other insects and even young mice. Rough spines protect
                the SWoT from potential predators. It is known to hiss at attackers, but is all talk and no action.

                believed to be an unclassified reptile or amphibian, and grows to the size of a man's arm. Descriptions
                vary. In some accounts the animal has two legs, in others four or none at all. It is said to have the
                face of a cat, and in many descriptions the front part is feline including the legs. This animal is
                illusive and viewed as malicious, attacking livestock or people who disturb its holes. -- Also known as

                Every child has had the fantasy that their favorite stuffed toy comes to life and becomes their new pet.
                These curious and gentle creatures, known as "trinkets" are the result of children's wishes. Some are
                made of cotton, some denim, some chenile, and all with shiny plastic eyes and little yarn whiskers to
                explore their world. They have come to life upon request, but be gentle with them. They are sensitive
                animals who can become easily depressed and are used to lots of hugs and love. (Trinkets are inspired by
                a variety of plush toys.)<br>

                Related to other songbirds such as cardinals, cowbirds, and chickadees, the Twitter is a shy creature
                with a small voice. Not much is known about these birds' habits, but their wide color sceme suggests
                they are adapted to a variety of habitats, and their quiet voices suggests they live high in tree tops.
                (This breed is a product of my own imagination but inspired by real bird species.)<br>
