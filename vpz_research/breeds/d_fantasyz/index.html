    <h2>Fantasyz (Dogz)</h2>

    <p>All my breedz are proudly made from the original PFM breedz! "From
    scratch." ;-) Sounds I use are either in game, compiled by me, or from
    Carolyn, whose brilliance is a great inspiration, and her patience is
    astounding.</p>

    <p>These are breed files that allow you to adopt petz from the Adoption
    Center in the game. Do not directly link to my files, and if you distribute
    them, please give me credit. Breedz are listed alphabetically.</p>

    <p>.dog files need to go in Resource\Dogz The files are zipped, so you need
    an unzipping program such as <u>WinZip </u>to use them. You do not need any
    other breedz files or anything to use these. Sound files are available when
    possible. If sounds aren't available, they may be eventually, but the breed
    is currently silent (not cat/dog sounds).</p>

    <p><b class="big">***If only one file is available, it is a "unibreed" file
    that will work in Petz 3, 4, and 5!</b></p>

    <p><i>If you have trouble downloading, right-click the link and choose "Save
    Target As..." All the files should work. (Although I can't verify Petz 3 or
    4 downloads, since I don't use those games.) Sometimes files are interrupted
    in download, and you get corrupted messages, especially for large files and
    especially if you use dial-up. TRY AGAIN LATER.</i></p>

                <img src="29db2410.gif"><br>
                <p>Achihond or "Angel Hounds" got their name from rare sightings
                by people who believed they were angels. While they are peaceful
                creatures, achihond are as mortal as you or I. They make their
                home in the secluded and barren polar regions, where they rarely
                come into conflict with man or beast. They form family groups
                but don't hunt as packs, because they take only fish, birds,
                small mammals, and any other small prey they can acquire.
                Pressures of famine years have pushed toward the evolution of
                wings, and some more adventurous animals migrate to other areas
                to find food, and some have taken a fondness of shiny trinkets.
                (The small ones are especially adept thieves.) Sightings remain
                rare, however, because achihond are swift, timid, and
                camouflaged by the clouds or snow, while they travel by
                daylight. (This breed is entirely of my invention.)</p>

                <p>Whether hangng out with demons, solving murder mysteries, or
                dueling each other with monsters, kids abound in the anime
                universe. They have big eyes, crazy hair colors, and often
                abilities above and beyond the adults around them. Adorable and
                endearing, but there is often more to these kids than meets the
                eye. (This breed was inspired by characters in many anime
                series.)</p>

                <p>A man traveling through the mountains one night spotted a
                light shining from behind a wind-ravaged spruce. As the creature
                raised its long neck, the man realized the light was starlight
                reflected in its large eyes. When the timid beast saw the man,
                it retreated into darkness. The man returned to his town with
                his story, and the creature was named the Astrocus, "star
                eyes."</p>

                <p>A gentle herbivorous mammal, believed by some to have evolved
                from ancient dragons as they moved to higher elevations and
                colder climates, the astrocus lives in small family groups to
                medium sized herds. A longer haired subspecies prevails in
                higher altitudes and colder climates, while a shorter haired
                variety live in warmer areas, but all are mountain-dwelling.
                They eat primarily bark, berries, and lichen and avoid contact
                with other animals (though sometimes clash with mountain goats
                over territory). In areas near people, the pelt of the rare
                astrocus is sought by hunters as a prize, and in these regions,
                the animals do not grow quite as large and have adapted the
                habit of hiding in crevices and remaining mostly nocturnal.

                <p>According to European mythology, the barghest is a large
                black dog with large teeth and claws that appeared only at
                night. Seeing the dog foretold death, and anyone who caught a
                glimpse of it would surely die. The dog itself is a specter, an
                omen, perhaps not violent... The barghest has equivalents of
                other names, the Gwyllgi, the Dog of Darkness, or the Mauthe
                Dog. (This breed was inspired by European lore.)</p>

                <p>Pliny once described a wolfdog creature with powerful jaws

                artistic licence, I have created the beast of imagination, a
                powerful animal with supernatural jaws and strength. The body
                shape and spots are somewhat hyena-like, merging the fact with
                the fantasy.</p>

                <p>Whenever sadness or misery struck the village, a gray dog was
                seen wandering the outskirts of town. The dog looked frightening
                to the villagers, and they called it the bringer of misfortune.
                So they caught and destroyed the beast, hoping to bring
                happiness back to their village. But with the dog gone, the
                sadness and pain returned to the town and lingered there.
                Illness that was once brief now required weeks of bedrest. After
                deaths, people felt depressed and were in inconsolable mourning
                for months. After some time passed, a gray puppy wandered into
                the home of a widow. Being lonely, she cared for the pup, and as
                he grew, her sadness subsided as did the sadness of those around
                her. He absorbed the sorrow, taking it upon himself and
                transforming him from a perky pup to a sorrowful shaggy adult.
                These creatures are called Despair, and they bear the burdens of
                others' suffering, a heavy weight indeed. While they are noble
                creatures, their appearence makes most, those who misinterpret
                their purpose, fearful and hateful, and they chase the dogs
                away. (This creature and story are of my own invention.)</p>

                not seem fixable at this time. To help avoid problems, make sure
                to back up your pet files, and if using Petz5a, set the number

                <p>On four moons orbiting a distant planet exist four races of
                Nubik. Nubik's show a lot of diversity in terns of snouts and
                ears. They eat mainly small animals (equivalents of insects and
                crustaceans) and show a division in niches with short-snouted
                nubits eating surface things, and longer-snouted ones gathering
                food from borrows. Each moon has its own color of Nubik,
                considered subspecies -- there has not been much morphological
                divergence, however. The moon of the gray nubiks is mostly gray
                rocks with deep chasms and high mountains. Gray nubiks live in
                caves. The moon of the brown nubik is dry chapparal (scrubland)
                and desert with few thorny shrubs and sandy soil, where the
                nubiks build dens under rocks. The moon of the red nubik is a
                thick rainforest full of brilliantly colored species and
                hundreds of tree species creating a closed canopy. Red nubiks
                live in hollow stumps. The pastel nubiks live on a moon of
                mostly grasslands with gentle streams and many varieties of
                wildflowers. Pastel nubiks are more open and prefer to rest in
                the shade of small trees that dot the landscape. (Nubiks are my
                own original creation.)</p>

                <p>Every year, millions of dogs are euthanized in shelters in
                the USA, simply because homes are not available. These dogz have
                done no wrong but are simply the result of overpopulation, lack
                of spaying/neutering, and intentional and unintentional
                overbreeding. While they have no "papers," shelter dogs make
                wonderful pets, as well as doing rescue work, police work, and
                therapy work. Movies and TV frequently use dogs from shelters as
                their "stars," as many are very intelligent and eager to please.
                Shelter dogs can be purebred or mixed, and are the best place to
                begin any search for a canine companion.</p>

                <p>The Sylvan Shepherd, as its name suggests, is fond of
                forests. In fact, that is where they are always found. These
                dogz become depressed when taken from their forests, even to the
                point of not eating. These semi-domestic dogz are usually
                companions to wandering druidic types, or, as it is rumored,
                elven or faerie folk. Sylvan Shepherds are believed to be
                related to herding/pastoral breedz and their loyalty is
                legendary. They fiercely protect those they choose as friends.
                The Sylvan Shepherd is often found with one or more companions,
                be it a person, cat, fox, rodent, or anything else. Even the
                insects in the woods are drawn to this dog's charismatic ways.
                If a Sylvan Shepherd is to befriend you, you have a lifelong
                companion and tireless protector.</p>

                <p>Winged dogz began showing up among the populations some time
                ago. According to legend, a young female dog was being kept by
                an elven woman. As the dog protected the woman's family, she
                protected her dog's new puppies and cherished them. One terribly
                dry autumn day, however, a fire spread through the village. The
                woman carried the pups to safety and got her children out too,
                but in the confusion, the mother dog was still searching the
                house for the family and was trapped inside... After this
                tragedy, the woman cast a spell, providing the puppies and any
                future descendents in wings, so they could save themselves as
                well as saving their friends.</p>

                <p>Unicorns, while often depicted in modern artwork as horned
                horses, are often shown is older art as much smaller and
                different-looking animals. The unicorn was believed to have the
                head of a horse, feet of a goat, and tail of a lion. The
                unicorn's horn was probably used as defense, but it was prized
                by chemists (anchient pharmacists) and others as a universal
                cure of sorts and also prized for magical properties. If a
                unicorn's horn was removed, it was believed that a priceless
                ruby, the source of the unicorn's powers, was at the base of the
                horn. This ruby is not seen in all unicorns, perhaps it is
                crystalized blood found only among the oldest and wisest of
                these creatures. (This breed was inspired by European lore.)</p>
