      <!-- How and Why I Hex ---------------------------------------------------->

      <h2>How and Why I Hex...</h2>
      <p>
        People have different reasons and methods of hexing. For me, it is a
        hobby and sort of an art form. I have no desire to be popular or to
        fulfill other peoples' desires. I do it because I enjoy it, and it is an
        outlet for my creativity. I like the problem solving that goes along
        with getting animals to look right, move right, breed true, and extra
        features such as having young ones change as they grow. That said, it
        should come as no surprise that
        <b class="o">I don't do requests.</b> There are things I like hexing and
        things I don't like. When the urge hits me, I'll switch gears and try
        something new. I am not a fan of popularity or "peer pressure" (though
        those who request things usually aren't that close to peers; no offense
        but a 20-something such as myself doesn't have much in common with the
        pre-graduation crowd). That's just the way I work. -- How I hex is very
        simple. I use ResHack (mostly), pay attention to hexing techniques
        others have tried, and experiment liberally myself. I like to try toying
        with most everything within a breed file...
      </p>

      <p>
        My favorite things to hex are cartoon creatures, cats, and rodents, but
        I switch gears and try new things all the time. I choose my base
        according to build and personality (as in, does it climb trees? Hiss?
        Growl? Dig?). Most of my "cartoonish" creatures are catz-based. For the
        sturdier and/or clumsier beasts, I often choose dogz.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b
          ><i
            >I am a free spirit. Not even I know what I will create next, so
            please put up with my eccentricities, hang on, and enjoy the
            ride!</i

      <p>
        First of all, I strongly encourage sharing! Feel free to post my breedz,
        scenes, etc. for download! Make litterz! enjoy! However, since I have
        put a lot of work into them and came up with everything on my own (with
        a little help and suggestions from friends), I do ask that you follow a
        few basic rules. Five dos and 5 don'ts seem fair, right?
      </p>

              <li>
                You may upload my files to your own server to download, as long
                as you provide a link to this site and a note that I made them.
              </li>
              <li>
                You may hex-paint and edit the files for personal use (personal

                You may use any of the sounds or textures I have created. ;-)
                (Make sure I made them and didn't borrow them. I ask permission
                before doing so.)

              </li>
              <li>
                Don't copy parts of my code into breedz you are making (except
                for my copy-paste free codes).
              </li>
              <li>
                Don't give out any of my files without giving me credit and a
                link.
              </li>
              <li>
                Don't give out altered breed files, including minor hex-painting
                and/or major changes. (Meaning you cannot use one of my files to
                create your own breed.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Don't make any file "overwriting." This removes its identity
                from me. If you would like to see an overwriting version, ask
                me.

      <p>
        <i><b>Note:</b></i> Some computers have errors with some versions
        (Windows XP and Me). I won't be held responsible if something screws up.
        I have these OS related problems myself and will let you know which
        breedz have the problems.

      <p>
        <i><b>Note 3:</b></i
        >I do all my own hexing, but I sometimes "borrow" sounds. Sound credit
        goes to the people who made them (which are indicated). If someone helps
        me out a lot or lets me borrow some code (I always get permission), they
        are also indicated. I also indicate anyone who has done a conversion.
        Many thanks to all of you!
